A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A methodology for visualizing analytic and synthetic geometry in R/sup N/ is presented. It is based on a system of parallel coordinates which induces a nonprojective mapping between N-dimensional and two-dimensional sets. Hypersurfaces are represented by their planar images which have some geometrical properties analogous to the properties of the hypersurface that they represent. A point from to line duality when N=2 generalizes to lines and hyperplanes enabling the representation of polyhedra in R/sup N/. The representation of a class of convex and non-convex hypersurfaces is discussed, together with an algorithm for constructing and displaying any interior point. The display shows some local properties of the hypersurface and provides information on the point's proximity to the boundary. Applications are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Terrain visualization is a difficult problem for applications requiring accurate images of large datasets at high frame rates, such as flight simulation and ground-based aircraft testing using synthetic sensor simulation. On current graphics hardware, the problem is to maintain dynamic, view-dependent triangle meshes and texture maps that produce good images at the required frame rate. We present an algorithm for constructing triangle meshes that optimizes flexible view-dependent error metrics, produces guaranteed error bounds, achieves specified triangle counts directly and uses frame-to-frame coherence to operate at high frame rates for thousands of triangles per frame. Our method, dubbed Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM), uses two priority queues to drive split and merge operations that maintain continuous triangulations built from pre-processed bintree triangles. We introduce two additional performance optimizations: incremental triangle stripping and priority-computation deferral lists. ROAM's execution time is proportional to the number of triangle changes per frame, which is typically a few percent of the output mesh size; hence ROAM's performance is insensitive to the resolution and extent of the input terrain. Dynamic terrain and simple vertex morphing are supported.
Nowadays, direct volume rendering via 3D textures has positioned itself as an efficient tool for the display and visual analysis of volumetric scalar fields. It is commonly accepted, that for reasonably sized data sets appropriate quality at interactive rates can be achieved by means of this technique. However, despite these benefits one important issue has received little attention throughout the ongoing discussion of texture based volume rendering: the integration of acceleration techniques to reduce per-fragment operations. In this paper, we address the integration of early ray termination and empty-space skipping into texture based volume rendering on graphical processing units (GPU). Therefore, we describe volume ray-casting on programmable graphics hardware as an alternative to object-order approaches. We exploit the early z-test to terminate fragment processing once sufficient opacity has been accumulated, and to skip empty space along the rays of sight. We demonstrate performance gains up to a factor of 3 for typical renditions of volumetric data sets on the ATI 9700 graphics card.
We introduce, analyze and quantitatively compare a number of surface simplification methods for point-sampled geometry. We have implemented incremental and hierarchical clustering, iterative simplification, and particle simulation algorithms to create approximations of point-based models with lower sampling density. All these methods work directly on the point cloud, requiring no intermediate tesselation. We show how local variation estimation and quadric error metrics can be employed to diminish the approximation error and concentrate more samples in regions of high curvature. To compare the quality of the simplified surfaces, we have designed a new method for computing numerical and visual error estimates for point-sampled surfaces. Our algorithms are fast, easy to implement, and create high-quality surface approximations, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of point-based surface simplification.
The key to real-time rendering of large-scale surfaces is to locally adapt surface geometric complexity to changing view parameters. Several schemes have been developed to address this problem of view-dependent level-of-detail control. Among these, the view-dependent progressive mesh (VDPM) framework represents an arbitrary triangle mesh as a hierarchy of geometrically optimized refinement transformations, from which accurate approximating meshes can be efficiently retrieved. In this paper we extend the general VDPM framework to provide temporal coherence through the run-time creation of geomorphs. These geomorphs eliminate "popping" artifacts by smoothly interpolating geometry. Their implementation requires new output-sensitive data structures, which have the added benefit of reducing memory use. We specialize the VDPM framework to the important case of terrain rendering. To handle huge terrain grids, we introduce a block-based simplification scheme that constructs a progressive mesh as a hierarchy of block refinements. We demonstrate the need for an accurate approximation metric during simplification. Our contributions are highlighted in a real-time flyover of a large, rugged terrain. Notably, the use of geomorphs results in visually smooth rendering even at 72 frames/sec on a graphics workstation.
We advocate the use of point sets to represent shapes. We provide a definition of a smooth manifold surface from a set of points close to the original surface. The definition is based on local maps from differential geometry, which are approximated by the method of moving least squares (MLS). We present tools to increase or decrease the density of the points, thus, allowing an adjustment of the spacing among the points to control the fidelity of the representation. To display the point set surface, we introduce a novel point rendering technique. The idea is to evaluate the local maps according to the image resolution. This results in high quality shading effects and smooth silhouettes at interactive frame rates.
A method for computing isovalue or contour surfaces of a trivariate function is discussed. The input data are values of the trivariate function, F/sub ijk/, at the cuberille grid points (x/sub i/, y/sub j/, z/sub k/), and the output of a collection of triangles representing the surface consisting of all points where F(x,y,z) is a constant value. The method is a modification that is intended to correct a problem with a previous method.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
There are a variety of application areas in which there is a need for simplifying complex polygonal surface models. These models often have material properties such as colors, textures, and surface normals. Our surface simplification algorithm, based on iterative edge contraction and quadric error metrics, can rapidly produce high quality approximations of such models. We present a natural extension of our original error metric that can account for a wide range of vertex attributes.
Much of the attention in visualization research has focussed on data rooted in physical phenomena, which is generally limited to three or four dimensions. However, many sources of data do not share this dimensional restriction. A critical problem in the analysis of such data is providing researchers with tools to gain insights into characteristics of the data, such as anomalies and patterns. Several visualization methods have been developed to address this problem, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a system named XmdvTool which integrates several of the most common methods for projecting multivariate data onto a two-dimensional screen. This integration allows users to explore their data in a variety of formats with ease. A view enhancement mechanism called an N-dimensional brush is also described. The brush allows users to gain insights into spatial relationships over N dimensions by highlighting data which falls within a user-specified subspace.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Our ability to accumulate large, complex (multivariate) data sets has far exceeded our ability to effectively process them in searching for patterns, anomalies and other interesting features. Conventional multivariate visualization techniques generally do not scale well with respect to the size of the data set. The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization of large multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallel coordinates display technique. We develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation of parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system. Lastly, we show examples of the tools and techniques applied to large (hundreds of thousands of records) multivariate data sets.
Complex triangle meshes arise naturally in many areas of computer graphics and visualization. Previous work has shown that a quadric error metric allows fast and accurate geometric simplification of meshes. This quadric approach was recently generalized to handle meshes with appearance attributes. In this paper we present an improved quadric error metric for simplifying meshes with attributes. The new metric, based on geometric correspondence in 3D, requires less storage, evaluates more quickly, and results in more accurate simplified meshes. Meshes often have attribute discontinuities, such as surface creases and material boundaries, which require multiple attribute vectors per vertex. We show that a wedge-based mesh data structure captures such discontinuities efficiently and permits simultaneous optimization of these multiple attribute vectors. In addition to the new quadric metric, we experiment with two techniques proposed in geometric simplification, memoryless simplification and volume preservation, and show that both of these are beneficial within the quadric framework. The new scheme is demonstrated on a variety of meshes with colors and normals.
Direct volume rendering of scalar fields uses a transfer function to map locally measured data properties to opacities and colors. The domain of the transfer function is typically the one-dimensional space of scalar data values. This paper advances the use of curvature information in multi-dimensional transfer functions, with a methodology for computing high-quality curvature measurements. The proposed methodology combines an implicit formulation of curvature with convolution-based reconstruction of the field. We give concrete guidelines for implementing the methodology, and illustrate the importance of choosing accurate filters for computing derivatives with convolution. Curvature-based transfer functions are shown to extend the expressivity and utility of volume rendering through contributions in three different application areas: nonphotorealistic volume rendering, surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion, and visualization of isosurface uncertainty.
The authors introduce the contour spectrum, a user interface component that improves qualitative user interaction and provides real-time exact quantification in the visualization of isocontours. The contour spectrum is a signature consisting of a variety of scalar data and contour attributes, computed over the range of scalar values /spl omega//spl isin/R. They explore the use of surface, area, volume, and gradient integral of the contour that are shown to be univariate B-spline functions of the scalar value /spl omega/ for multi-dimensional unstructured triangular grids. These quantitative properties are calculated in real-time and presented to the user as a collection of signature graphs (plots of functions of /spl omega/) to assist in selecting relevant isovalues /spl omega//sub 0/ for informative visualization. For time-varying data, these quantitative properties can also be computed over time, and displayed using a 2D interface, giving the user an overview of the time-varying function, and allowing interaction in both isovalue and time step. The effectiveness of the current system and potential extensions are discussed.
Most direct volume renderings produced today employ one-dimensional transfer functions, which assign color and opacity to the volume based solely on the single scalar quantity which comprises the dataset. Though they have not received widespread attention, multi-dimensional transfer functions are a very effective way to extract specific material boundaries and convey subtle surface properties. However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional transfer functions for scalar data (based on data value, gradient magnitude, and a second directional derivative), and describes a set of direct manipulation widgets which make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient. We also describe how to use modem graphics hardware to interactively render with multi-dimensional transfer functions. The transfer functions, widgets, and hardware combine to form a powerful system for interactive volume exploration.
Conventional projector-based display systems are typically designed around precise and regular configurations of projectors and display surfaces. While this results in rendering simplicity and speed, it also means painstaking construction and ongoing maintenance. In previously published work, we introduced a vision of projector-based displays constructed from a collection of casually-arranged projectors and display surfaces. In this paper, we present flexible yet practical methods for realizing this vision, enabling low-cost mega-pixel display systems with large physical dimensions, higher resolution, or both. The techniques afford new opportunities to build personal 3D visualization systems in offices, conference rooms, theaters, or even your living room. As a demonstration of the simplicity and effectiveness of the methods that we continue to perfect, we show in the included video that a 10-year old child can construct and calibrate a two-camera, two-projector, head-tracked display system, all in about 15 minutes.
Real-time rendering of triangulated surfaces has attracted growing interest in the last few years. However, interactive visualization of very large scale grid digital elevation models is still difficult. The graphics load must be controlled by adaptive surface triangulation and by taking advantage of different levels of detail. Furthermore, management of the visible scene requires efficient access to the terrain database. We describe an all-in-one visualization system which integrates adaptive triangulation, dynamic scene management and spatial data handling. The triangulation model is based on the restricted quadtree triangulation. Furthermore, we present new algorithms of restricted quadtree triangulation. These include among others exact error approximation, progressive meshing, performance enhancements and spatial access.
We present an elegant and simple to implement framework for performing out-of-core visualization and view-dependent refinement of large terrain surfaces. Contrary to the trend of increasingly elaborate algorithms for large-scale terrain visualization, our algorithms and data structures have been designed with the primary goal of simplicity and efficiency of implementation. Our approach to managing large terrain data also departs from more conventional strategies based on data tiling. Rather than emphasizing how to segment and efficiently bring data in and out of memory, we focus on the manner in which the data is laid out to achieve good memory coherency for data accesses made in a top-down (coarse-to-fine) refinement of the terrain. We present and compare the results of using several different data indexing schemes, and propose a simple to compute index that yields substantial improvements in locality and speed over more commonly used data layouts. Our second contribution is a new and simple, yet easy to generalize method for view-dependent refinement. Similar to several published methods in this area, we use longest edge bisection in a top-down traversal of the mesh hierarchy to produce a continuous surface with subdivision connectivity. In tandem with the refinement, we perform view frustum culling and triangle stripping. These three components are done together in a single pass over the mesh. We show how this framework supports virtually any error metric, while still being highly memory and compute efficient.
Presents an algorithm for performing view-dependent simplifications of a triangulated polygonal model in real-time. The simplifications are dependent on viewing direction, lighting and visibility, and are performed by taking advantage of image-space, object-space and frame-to-frame coherences. A continuous level-of-detail representation for an object is first constructed off-line. This representation is then used at run-time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer.
Accurately and automatically conveying the structure of a volume model is a problem that has not been fully solved by existing volume rendering approaches. Physics-based volume rendering approaches create images which may match the appearance of translucent materials in nature but may not embody important structural details. Transfer function approaches allow flexible design of the volume appearance but generally require substantial hand-tuning for each new data set in order to be effective. We introduce the volume illustration approach, combining the familiarity of a physics-based illumination model with the ability to enhance important features using non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Since the features to be enhanced are defined on the basis of local volume characteristics rather than volume sample values, the application of volume illustration techniques requires less manual tuning than the design of a good transfer function. Volume illustration provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing structural perception of volume models through the amplification of features and the addition of illumination effects.
Conventional wisdom says that in order to produce high-quality simplified polygonal models, one must retain and use information about the original model during the simplification process. We demonstrate that excellent simplified models can be produced without the need to compare against information from the original geometry while performing local changes to the model. We use edge collapses to perform simplification, as do a number of other methods. We select the position of the new vertex so that the original volume of the model is maintained and we minimize the per-triangle change in volume of the tetrahedra swept out by those triangles that are moved. We also maintain surface area near boundaries and minimize the per-triangle area changes. Calculating the edge collapse priorities and the positions of the new vertices requires only the face connectivity and the the vertex locations in the intermediate model. This approach is memory efficient, allowing the simplification of very large polygonal models, and it is also fast. Moreover, simplified models created using this technique compare favorably to a number of other published simplification methods in terms of mean geometric error.
We show that it is feasible to perform interactive isosurfacing of very large rectilinear datasets with brute-force ray tracing on a conventional (distributed) shared-memory multiprocessor machine. Rather than generate geometry representing the isosurface and render with a z-buffer, for each pixel we trace a ray through a volume and do an analytic isosurface intersection computation. Although this method has a high intrinsic computational cost, its simplicity and scalability make it ideal for large datasets on current high-end systems. Incorporating simple optimizations, such as volume bricking and a shallow hierarchy, enables interactive rendering (i.e. 10 frames per second) of the 1 GByte full resolution Visible Woman dataset on an SGI Reality Monster. The graphics capabilities of the Reality Monster are used only for display of the final color image.
The field of visualization is getting mature. Many problems have been solved, and new directions are sought for. In order to make good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. Especially, it would be nice if we could assess what a good visualization is. In this paper an attempt is made to determine the value of visualization. A technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented, and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences (brand limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjective/less, and the role of interaction), as well as examples of the use of the model for the judgement of existing classes of methods and understanding why they are or are not used in practice. Furthermore, two alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: viewing visualization as an art or as a scientific discipline. Implications and future directions are identified.
To render images from a three-dimensional array of sample values, it is necessary to interpolate between the samples. This paper is concerned with interpolation methods that are equivalent to convolving the samples with a reconstruction filter; this covers all commonly used schemes, including trilinear and cubic interpolation. We first outline the formal basis of interpolation in three-dimensional signal processing theory. We then propose numerical metrics that can be used to measure filter characteristics that are relevant to the appearance of images generated using that filter. We apply those metrics to several previously used filters and relate the results to isosurface images of the interpolations. We show that the choice of interpolation scheme can have a dramatic effect on image quality, and we discuss the cost/benefit tradeoff inherent in choosing a filter.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper presents a set of combined techniques to enhance the real-time visualization of simple or complex molecules (up to order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; atoms) space fill mode. The proposed approach includes an innovative technique for efficient computation and storage of ambient occlusion terms, a small set of GPU accelerated procedural impostors for space-fill and ball-and-stick rendering, and novel edge-cueing techniques. As a result, the user's understanding of the three-dimensional structure under inspection is strongly increased (even for'still images), while the rendering still occurs in real time
We present a multiresolution technique for interactive texture-based volume visualization of very large data sets. This method uses an adaptive scheme that renders the volume in a region-of-interest at a high resolution and the volume away from this region at progressively lower resolutions. The algorithm is based on the segmentation of texture space into an octree, where the leaves of the tree define the original data and the internal nodes define lower-resolution versions. Rendering is done adaptively by selecting high-resolution cells close to a center of attention and low-resolution cells away from this area. We limit the artifacts introduced by this method by modifying the transfer functions in the lower-resolution data sets and utilizing spherical shells as a proxy geometry. It is possible to use this technique to produce viewpoint-dependent renderings of very large data sets.
Volume visualization techniques typically provide support for visual exploration of data, however additional information can be conveyed by allowing a user to see as well as feel virtual objects. We present a haptic interaction method that is suitable for both volume visualization and modeling applications. Point contact forces are computed directly from the volume data and are consistent with the isosurface and volume rendering methods, providing a strong correspondence between visual and haptic feedback. Virtual tools are simulated by applying three-dimensional filters to some properties of the data within the extent of the tool, and interactive visual feedback rates are obtained by using an accelerated ray casting method. This haptic interaction method was implemented using a PHANToM haptic interface.
We describe a technique for choosing multiple colours for use during data visualization. Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.
The authors present a tool for the display and analysis of N-dimensional data based on a technique called dimensional stacking. This technique is described. The primary goal is to create a tool that enables the user to project data of arbitrary dimensions onto a two-dimensional image. Of equal importance is the ability to control the viewing parameters, so that one can interactively adjust what ranges of values each dimension takes and the form in which the dimensions are displayed. This will allow an intuitive feel for the data to be developed as the database is explored. The system uses dimensional stacking, to collapse and N-dimension space down into a 2-D space and then render the values contained therein. Each value can then be represented as a pixel or rectangular region on a 2-D screen whose intensity corresponds to the data value at that point.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Progress in scientific visualization could be accelerated if workers could more readily find visualization techniques relevant to a given problem. The authors describe an approach to this problem, based on a classification of visualization techniques, that is independent of particular application domains. A user breaks up a problem into subproblems, describes these subproblems in terms of the objects to be represented and the operations to be supported by a representation, locates applicable visualization techniques in a catalog, and combines these representations into a composite representation for the original problem. The catalog and its underlying classification provide a way for workers in different application disciplines to share methods.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
VisTrails is a new system that enables interactive multiple-view visualizations by simplifying the creation and maintenance of visualization pipelines, and by optimizing their execution. It provides a general infrastructure that can be combined with existing visualization systems and libraries. A key component of VisTrails is the visualization trail (vistrail), a formal specification of a pipeline. Unlike existing dataflow-based systems, in VisTrails there is a clear separation between the specification of a pipeline and its execution instances. This separation enables powerful scripting capabilities and provides a scalable mechanism for generating a large number of visualizations. VisTrails also leverages the vistrail specification to identify and avoid redundant operations. This optimization is especially useful while exploring multiple visualizations. When variations of the same pipeline need to be executed, substantial speedups can be obtained by caching the results of overlapping subsequences of the pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of VisTrails, and show its effectiveness in different application scenarios.
A new multiscale method in surface processing is presented which combines the image processing methodology based on nonlinear diffusion equations and the theory of geometric evolution problems. Its aim is to smooth discretized surfaces while simultaneously enhancing geometric features such as edges and corners. This is obtained by an anisotropic curvature evolution, where time is the multiscale parameter. Here, the diffusion tensor depends on the shape operator of the evolving surface. A spatial finite element discretization on arbitrary unstructured triangular meshes and a semi-implicit finite difference discretization in time are the building blocks of the easy to code algorithm presented. The systems of linear equations in each timestep are solved by appropriate, preconditioned iterative solvers. Different applications underline the efficiency and flexibility of the presented type of surface processing tool.
Almost all scientific visualization involving surfaces is currently done via triangles. The speed at which such triangulated surfaces can be displayed is crucial to interactive visualization and is bounded by the rate at which triangulated data can be sent to the graphics subsystem for rendering. Partitioning polygonal models into triangle strips can significantly reduce rendering times over transmitting each triangle individually. We present new and efficient algorithms for constructing triangle strips from partially triangulated models, and experimental results showing these strips are on average 15% better than those from previous codes. Further, we study the impact of larger buffer sizes and various queuing disciplines on the effectiveness of triangle strips.
Recently, researchers have started using texture for data visualization. The rationale behind this is to exploit the sensitivity of the human visual system to texture in order to overcome the limitations inherent in the display of multidimensional data. A fundamental issue that must be addressed is what textural features are important in texture perception, and how they are used. We designed an experiment to help identify the relevant higher order features of texture perceived by humans. We used twenty subjects, who were asked to rate 56 pictures from Brodatz's album on 12 nine-point Likert scales. We applied the techniques of hierarchical cluster analysis, non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS), classification and regression tree analysis (CART), discriminant analysis, and principal component analysis to data gathered from the subjects. Based on these techniques, we identified three orthogonal dimensions for texture to be repetitive vs. non-repetitive; high-contrast and non-directional vs. low-contrast and directional; granular, coarse and low-complexity vs. non-granular, fine and high-complexity.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a 'recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.
The Visualization Toolkit (vtk) is a freely available C++ class library for 3D graphics and visualization. We describe core characteristics of the toolkit. This includes a description of object oriented models for graphics and visualization; methods for synchronizing system execution; a summary of data representation schemes; the role of C++; issues in portability across PC and Unix systems; and how we automatically wrap the C++ class library with interpreted languages such as Java and Tcl. We also demonstrate the capabilities of the system for scalar, vector, tensor, and other visualization techniques.
This paper presents a novel approach to assist the user in exploring appropriate transfer functions for the visualization of volumetric datasets. The search for a transfer function is treated as a parameter optimization problem and addressed with stochastic search techniques. Starting from an initial population of (random or pre-defined) transfer functions, the evolution of the stochastic algorithms is controlled by either direct user selection of intermediate images or automatic fitness evaluation using user-specified objective functions. This approach essentially shields the user from the complex and tedious "trial and error" approach, and demonstrates effective and convenient generation of transfer functions.
Tracking linear features through tensor field datasets is an open research problem with widespread utility in medical and engineering disciplines. Existing tracking methods, which consider only the preferred local diffusion direction as they propagate, fail to accurately follow features as they enter regions of local complexity. This shortcoming is a result of partial voluming; that is, voxels in these regions often contain contributions from multiple features. These combined contributions result in ambiguities when deciding local primary feature orientation based solely on the preferred diffusion direction. We introduce a novel feature extraction method which we term tensorline propagation. Our method resolves the above ambiguity by incorporating information about the nearby orientation of the feature, as well as the anisotropic classification of the local tensor. The nearby orientation information is added in the spirit of an advection term in a standard diffusion based propagation technique, and has the effect of stabilizing the tracking. To demonstrate the efficacy of tensorlines, we apply this method to the neuroscience problem of tracking white-matter bundles within the brain.
Describes data exploration techniques designed to classify DNA sequences. Several visualization and data mining techniques were used to validate and attempt to discover new methods for distinguishing coding DNA sequences (exons) from non-coding DNA sequences (introns). The goal of the data mining was to see whether some other, possibly non-linear combination of the fundamental position-dependent DNA nucleotide frequency values could be a better predictor than the AMI (average mutual information). We tried many different classification techniques including rule-based classifiers and neural networks. We also used visualization of both the original data and the results of the data mining to help verify patterns and to understand the distinction between the different types of data and classifications. In particular, the visualization helped us develop refinements to neural network classifiers, which have accuracies as high as any known method. Finally, we discuss the interactions between visualization and data mining and suggest an integrated approach.
Maintenance of a front of particles, an efficient method of generating a set of sample points over a two-dimensional stream surface, is described. The particles are repeatedly advanced a short distance through the flow field. New polygons are appended to the downstream edge of the surface. The spacing of the particles is adjusted to maintain an adequate sampling across the width of the growing surface. Curve and ribbon methods of vector field visualization are reviewed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a new algorithm for rendering very large volume data sets at interactive frame rates on standard PC hardware. The algorithm accepts scalar data sampled on a regular grid as input. The input data is converted into a compressed hierarchical wavelet representation in a preprocessing step. During rendering, the wavelet representation is decompressed on-the-fly and rendered using hardware texture mapping. The level of detail used for rendering is adapted to the local frequency spectrum of the data and its position relative to the viewer. Using a prototype implementation of the algorithm we were able to perform an interactive walkthrough of large data sets such as the visible human on a single off-the-shelf PC.
This paper introduces a method for smoothing complex, noisy surfaces, while preserving (and enhancing) sharp, geometric features. It has two main advantages over previous approaches to feature preserving surface smoothing. First is the use of level set surface models, which allows us to process very complex shapes of arbitrary and changing topology. This generality makes it well suited for processing surfaces that are derived directly from measured data. The second advantage is that the proposed method derives from a well-founded formulation, which is a natural generalization of anisotropic diffusion, as used in image processing. This formulation is based on the proposition that the generalization of image filtering entails filtering the normals of the surface, rather than processing the positions of points on a mesh.
Most existing visualization applications use 3D geometry as their basic rendering primitive. As users demand more complex data sets, the memory requirements for retrieving and storing large 3D models are becoming excessive. In addition, the current 3D rendering hardware is facing a large memory bus bandwidth bottleneck at the processor to graphics pipeline interface. Rendering 1 million triangles with 24 bytes per triangle at 30 Hz requires as much as 720 MB/sec memory bus bandwidth. This transfer rate is well beyond the current low-cost graphics systems. A solution is to compress the static 3D geometry as an off-line pre-process. Then, only the compressed geometry needs to be stored in main memory and sent down to the graphics pipeline for real-time decompression and rendering. The author presents several new techniques for compression of 3D geometry that produce 2 to 3 times better compression ratios than existing methods. They first introduce several algorithms for the efficient encoding of the original geometry as generalized triangle meshes. This encoding allows most of the mesh vertices to be reused when forming new triangles. Their second contribution allows various parts of a geometric model to be compressed with different precision depending on the level of details present. Together, the meshifying algorithms and the variable compression method achieve compression ratios of 30 and 37 to one over ASCII encoded formats and 10 and 15 to one over binary encoded triangle strips. The experimental results show a dramatically lowered memory bandwidth required for real-time visualization of complex data sets.
Large scale scientific simulation codes typically run on a cluster of CPUs that write/read time steps to/from a single file system. As data sets are constantly growing in size, this increasingly leads to I/O bottlenecks. When the rate at which data is produced exceeds the available I/O bandwidth, the simulation stalls and the CPUs are idle. Data compression can alleviate this problem by using some CPU cycles to reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered. Most compression schemes, however, are designed to operate offline and seek to maximize compression, not throughput. Furthermore, they often require quantizing floating-point values onto a uniform integer grid, which disqualifies their use in applications where exact values must be retained. We propose a simple scheme for lossless, online compression of floating-point data that transparently integrates into the I/O of many applications. A plug-in scheme for data-dependent prediction makes our scheme applicable to a wide variety of data used in visualization, such as unstructured meshes, point sets, images, and voxel grids. We achieve state-of-the-art compression rates and speeds, the latter in part due to an improved entropy coder. We demonstrate that this significantly accelerates I/O throughput in real simulation runs. Unlike previous schemes, our method also adapts well to variable-precision floating-point and integer data
Since the introduction of standard techniques for isosurface extraction from volumetric datasets, one of the hardest problems has been to reduce the number of triangles (or polygons) generated. The paper presents an algorithm that considerably reduces the number of polygons generated by a Marching Cubes-like scheme (W. Lorensen and H. Cline, 1987) without excessively increasing the overall computational complexity. The algorithm assumes discretization of the dataset space and replaces cell edge interpolation by midpoint selection. Under these assumptions, the extracted surfaces are composed of polygons lying within a finite number of incidences, thus allowing simple merging of the output facets into large coplanar polygons. An experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on datasets related to biomedical imaging and chemical modelling is reported.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Advances in computer graphics hardware and algorithms, visualization, and interactive techniques for analysis offer the components for a highly integrated, efficient real-time 3D Geographic Information System. We have developed "Virtual GIS", a system with truly immersive capability for navigating and understanding complex and dynamic terrain-based databases. The system provides the means for visualizing terrain models consisting of elevation and imagery data, along with GIS raster layers, protruding features, buildings, vehicles, and other objects. We have implemented window-based and virtual reality versions and in both cases provide a direct manipulation, visual interface for accessing the GIS data. Unique terrain data structures and algorithms allow rendering of large, high resolution datasets at interactive rates.
A new technique for interactive vector field visualization using large numbers of properly illuminated stream lines is presented. Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated stream lines within an interactive visualization environment.
We present a fast volume rendering algorithm for time-varying fields. We propose a new data structure, called time-space partitioning (TSP) tree, that can effectively capture both the spatial and the temporal coherence from a time-varying field. Using the proposed data structure, the rendering speed is substantially improved. In addition, our data structure helps to maintain the memory access locality and to provide the sparse data traversal so that our algorithm becomes suitable for large-scale out-of-core applications. Finally, our algorithm allows flexible error control for both the temporal and the spatial coherence so that a trade-off between image quality and rendering speed is possible. We demonstrate the utility and speed of our algorithm with data from several time-varying CFD simulations. Our rendering algorithm can achieve substantial speedup while the storage space overhead for the TSP tree is kept at a minimum.
Focus+context visualization integrates a visually accentuated representation of selected data items in focus (more details, more opacity, etc.) with a visually deemphasized representation of the rest of the data, i.e., the context. The role of context visualization is to provide an overview of the data for improved user orientation and improved navigation. A good overview comprises the representation of both outliers and trends. Up to now, however, context visualization not really treated outliers sufficiently. In this paper we present a new approach to focus+context visualization in parallel coordinates which is truthful to outliers in the sense that small-scale features are detected before visualization and then treated specially during context visualization. Generally, we present a solution which enables context visualization at several levels of abstraction, both for the representation of outliers and trends. We introduce outlier detection and context generation to parallel coordinates on the basis of a binned data representation. This leads to an output-oriented visualization approach which means that only those parts of the visualization process are executed which actually affect the final rendering. Accordingly, the performance of this solution is much more dependent on the visualization size than on the data size which makes it especially interesting for large datasets. Previous approaches are outperformed, the new solution was successfully applied to datasets with up to 3 million data records and up to 50 dimensions
Many computer graphics operations, such as texture mapping, 3D painting, remeshing, mesh compression, and digital geometry processing, require finding a low-distortion parameterization for irregular connectivity triangulations of arbitrary genus 2-manifolds. This paper presents a simple and fast method for computing parameterizations with strictly bounded distortion. The new method operates by flattening the mesh onto a region of the 2D plane. To comply with the distortion bound, the mesh is automatically cut and partitioned on-the-fly. The method guarantees avoiding global and local self-intersections, while attempting to minimize the total length of the introduced seams. To our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the mesh partitioning and the parameterization simultaneously and entirely automatically, while providing guaranteed distortion bounds. Our results on a variety of objects demonstrate that the method is fast enough to work with large complex irregular meshes in interactive applications.
This paper presents PixelFlex - a spatially reconfigurable multi-projector display system. The PixelFlex system is composed of ceiling-mounted projectors, each with computer-controlled pan, tilt, zoom and focus; and a camera for closed-loop calibration. Working collectively, these controllable projectors function as a single logical display capable of being easily modified into a variety of spatial formats of differing pixel density, size and shape. New layouts are automatically calibrated within minutes to generate the accurate warping and blending functions needed to produce seamless imagery across planar display surfaces, thus giving the user the flexibility to quickly create, save and restore multiple screen configurations. Overall, PixelFlex provides a new level of automatic reconfigurability and usage, departing from the static, one-size-fits-all design of traditional large-format displays. As a front-projection system, PixelFlex can be installed in most environments with space constraints and requires little or no post-installation mechanical maintenance because of the closed-loop calibration.
In a visualization of a three-dimensional dataset, the insights gained are dependent on what is occluded and what is not. Suggestion of interesting viewpoints can improve both the speed and efficiency of data understanding. This paper presents a view selection method designed for volume rendering. It can be used to find informative views for a given scene, or to find a minimal set of representative views which capture the entire scene. It becomes particularly useful when the visualization process is non-interactive - for example, when visualizing large datasets or time-varying sequences. We introduce a viewpoint "goodness" measure based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the transfer function, the data distribution and the visibility of the voxels. Combined with viewpoint properties like view-likelihood and view-stability, this technique can be used as a guide, which suggests "interesting" viewpoints for further exploration. Domain knowledge is incorporated into the algorithm via an importance transfer function or volume. This allows users to obtain view selection behaviors tailored to their specific situations. We generate a view space partitioning, and select one representative view for each partition. Together, this set of views encapsulates the "interesting" and distinct views of the data. Viewpoints in this set can be used as starting points for interactive exploration of the data, thus reducing the human effort in visualization. In non-interactive situations, such a set can be used as a representative visualization of the dataset from all directions.
A recently completed implementation of a virtual environment for exploring numerically generated three-dimensional unsteady flowfields is described. A boom-mounted six-degree-of-freedom head-position-sensitive stereo CRT system is used for viewing. A hand-position-sensitive glove controller is used for injecting various tracers (e.g. smoke) into the virtual flowfield. A multiprocessor graphics workstation is used for computation and rendering. The techniques for visualizing unsteady flows are described, and the computer requirements for a variety of visualization techniques are discussed. These techniques generalize to visualization of other 3D vector fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a method for interactive rendering of large outdoor scenes. Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically. With our system, we are able to interactively render very complex landscapes with good visual quality.
The paper presents an interactive approach for guiding the user's select of colormaps in visualization. PRAVDAColor, implemented as a module in the IBM Visualization Data Explorer, provides the user a selection of appropriate colormaps given the data type and spatial frequency, the user's task, and properties of the human perceptual system.
Illustrations play a major role in the education process. Whether used to teach a surgical or radiologic procedure, to illustrate normal or aberrant anatomy, or to explain the functioning of a technical device, illustration significantly impacts learning. Although many specimens are readily available as volumetric data sets, particularly in medicine, illustrations are commonly produced manually as static images in a time-consuming process. Our goal is to create a fully dynamic three-dimensional illustration environment which directly operates on volume data. Single images have the aesthetic appeal of traditional illustrations, but can be interactively altered and explored. In this paper we present methods to realize such a system which combines artistic visual styles and expressive visualization techniques. We introduce a novel concept for direct multi-object volume visualization which allows control of the appearance of inter-penetrating objects via two-dimensional transfer functions. Furthermore, a unifying approach to efficiently integrate many non-photorealistic rendering models is presented. We discuss several illustrative concepts which can be realized by combining cutaways, ghosting, and selective deformation. Finally, we also propose a simple interface to specify objects of interest through three-dimensional volumetric painting. All presented methods are integrated into VolumeShop, an interactive hardware-accelerated application for direct volume illustration.
We present efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for isosurface extraction. Based on the Span Space data representation, new data subdivision and searching methods are described. We also present a parallel implementation with an emphasis on load balancing. The performance of our sequential algorithm to locate the cell elements intersected by isosurfaces is faster than the Kd tree searching method originally used for the Span Space algorithm. The parallel algorithm can achieve high load balancing for massively parallel machines with distributed memory architectures.
The contour tree, an abstraction of a scalar field that encodes the nesting relationships of isosurfaces, can be used to accelerate isosurface extraction, to identify important isovalues for volume-rendering transfer functions, and to guide exploratory visualization through a flexible isosurface interface. Many real-world data sets produce unmanageably large contour trees which require meaningful simplification. We define local geometric measures for individual contours, such as surface area and contained volume, and provide an algorithm to compute these measures in a contour tree. We then use these geometric measures to simplify the contour trees, suppressing minor topological features of the data. We combine this with a flexible isosurface interface to allow users to explore individual contours of a dataset interactively.
The marching cubes (MC) algorithm is a method for generating isosurfaces. It also generates an excessively large number of triangles to represent an isosurface; this increases the rendering time. This paper presents a decimation method to reduce the number of triangles generated. Decimation is carried out before creating a large number of triangles. Four major steps comprise the algorithm: surface tracking, merging, crack patching and triangulation. Surface tracking is an enhanced implementation of the MC algorithm. Starting from a seed point, the surface tracker visits only those cells likely to compose part of the desired isosurface. The cells making up the extracted surface are stored in an octree that is further processed. A bottom-up approach is taken in merging the cells containing a relatively flat approximating surface. The finer surface details are maintained. Cells are merged as long as the error due to such an operation is within a user-specified error parameter, or a cell acquires more than one connected surface component in it. A crack patching method is described that forces edges of smaller cells to lie along those of the larger neighboring cells. The overall saving in the number of triangles depends both on the specified error value and the nature of the data. Use of the hierarchical octree data structure also presents the potential of incremental representation of surfaces. We can generate a highly smoothed surface representation which can be progressively refined as the user-specified error value is decreased.
VisIt is a richly featured visualization tool that is used to visualize some of the largest simulations ever run. The scale of these simulations requires that optimizations are incorporated into every operation VisIt performs. But the set of applicable optimizations that VisIt can perform is dependent on the types of operations being done. Complicating the issue, VisIt has a plugin capability that allows new, unforeseen components to be added, making it even harder to determine which optimizations can be applied. We introduce the concept of a contract to the standard data flow network design. This contract enables each component of the data flow network to modify the set of optimizations used. In addition, the contract allows for new components to be accommodated gracefully within VisIt's data flow network system.
We present a new visualization method for 2D flows which allows us to combine multiple data values in an image for simultaneous viewing. We utilize concepts from oil painting, art and design as introduced in (Laidlaw et al., 1998) to examine problems within fluid mechanics. We use a combination of discrete and continuous visual elements arranged in multiple layers to visually represent the data. The representations are inspired by the brush strokes artists apply in layers to create an oil painting. We display commonly visualized quantities such as velocity and vorticity together with three additional mathematically derived quantities: the rate of strain tensor, and the turbulent charge and turbulent current. We describe the motivation for simultaneously examining these quantities and use the motivation to guide our choice of visual representation for each particular quantity. We present visualizations of three flow examples and observations concerning some of the physical relationships made apparent by the simultaneous display technique that we employed.
This work introduces importance-driven volume rendering as a novel technique for automatic focus and context display of volumetric data. Our technique is a generalization of cut-away views, which - depending on the viewpoint - remove or suppress less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. We automatize and apply this idea to volumetric data. Each part of the volumetric data is assigned an object importance, which encodes visibility priority. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image. This work also discusses several possible schemes for level of sparseness specification and different ways how object importance can be composited to determine the final appearance of a particular object.
Numerical weather prediction ensembles are routinely used for operational weather forecasting. The members of these ensembles are individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March 1993 "Superstorm". A tool was designed to interactively explore the ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation pressure. Uncertainty was quantified using individual ensemble member standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial regions where the uncertainty was significantly high, allowing for identification of poorly simulated storm environments and physical interpretation of these model issues.
A technique that harnesses color and texture perception to create integrated displays of 2D image-like multiparameter distributions is presented. The power of the technique is demonstrated by an example of a synthesized dataset and compared with several other proposed techniques. The nature of studies that are required to measure objectively and accurately the effectiveness of such displays is discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
One of the most important goals in volume rendering is to be able to visually separate and selectively enable specific objects of interest contained in a single volumetric data set, which can be approached by using explicit segmentation information. We show how segmented data sets can be rendered interactively on current consumer graphics hardware with high image quality and pixel-resolution filtering of object boundaries. In order to enhance object perception, we employ different levels of object distinction. First, each object can be assigned an individual transfer function, multiple of which can be applied in a single rendering pass. Second, different rendering modes such as direct volume rendering, iso-surfacing, and non-photorealistic techniques can be selected for each object. A minimal number of rendering passes is achieved by processing sets of objects that share the same rendering mode in a single pass. Third, local compositing modes such as alpha blending and MIP can be selected for each object in addition to a single global mode, thus enabling high-quality two-level volume rendering on GPUs.
We present the first implementation of a volume ray casting algorithm for tetrahedral meshes running on off-the-shelf programmable graphics hardware. Our implementation avoids the memory transfer bottleneck of the graphics bus since the complete mesh data is stored in the local memory of the graphics adapter and all computations, in particular ray traversal and ray integration, are performed by the graphics processing unit. Analogously to other ray casting algorithms, our algorithm does not require an expensive cell sorting. Provided that the graphics adapter offers enough texture memory, our implementation performs comparable to the fastest published volume rendering algorithms for unstructured meshes. Our approach works with cyclic and/or non-convex meshes and supports early ray termination. Accurate ray integration is guaranteed by applying pre-integrated volume rendering. In order to achieve almost interactive modifications of transfer functions, we propose a new method for computing three-dimensional pre-integration tables.

Recent interest in large displays has led to renewed development of tiled displays, which are comprised of several individual displays arranged in an array and used as one large logical display. Stanford's "Interactive Mural" is an example of such a display, using an overlapping four by two array of projectors that back-project onto a diffuse screen to form a 6' by 2' display area with a resolution of over 60 dpi. Writing software to make effective use of the large display space is a challenge because normal window system interaction metaphors break down. One promising approach is to switch to immersive applications; another approach, the one we are investigating, is to emulate office, conference room or studio environments which use the space to display a collection of visual material to support group activities. We describe a virtual graphics system that is designed to support multiple simultaneous rendering streams from both local and remote sites. The system abstracts the physical number of computers, graphics subsystems and projectors used to create the display. We provide performance measurements to show that the system scales well and thus supports a variety of different hardware configurations. The system is also interesting because it uses transparent "layers", instead of windows, to manage the screen.
In many cases the surfaces of geometric models consist of a large number of triangles. Several algorithms were developed to reduce the number of triangles required to approximate such objects. Algorithms that measure the deviation between the approximated object and the original object are only available for special cases. We use the Hausdorff distance between the original and the simplified mesh as a geometrically meaningful error value which can be applied to arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a new algorithm to reduce the number of triangles of a mesh without exceeding a user defined Hausdorff distance between the original and simplified mesh. As this distance is parameterization independent, its use as error measure is superior to the use of the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm between parameterized surfaces. Furthermore the Hausdorff distance is always less than the distance induced by the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm. This results in higher reduction rates. Excellent results were achieved by the new decimation algorithm for triangle meshes that has been used in different application areas such as volume rendering, terrain modeling and the approximations of parameterized surfaces. The key advantages of the new algorithm are: it guarantees a user defined position dependent approximation error; it allows one to generate a hierarchical geometric representation in a canonical way; it automatically preserves sharp edges.
Visualization of tubular structures such as blood vessels is an important topic in medical imaging. One way to display tubular structures for diagnostic purposes is to generate longitudinal cross-sections in order to show their lumen, wall, and surrounding tissue in a curved plane. This process is called curved planar reformation (CPR). We present three different methods to generate CPR images. A tube-phantom was scanned with computed tomography (CT) to illustrate the properties of the different CPR methods. Furthermore we introduce enhancements to these methods: thick-CPR, rotating-CPR and multi-path-CPR.
We present two beneficial rendering extensions to the projected tetrahedra (PT) algorithm proposed by Shirley and Tuchman (1990). These extensions are compatible with any cell sorting technique, for example the BSP-XMPVO sorting algorithm for unstructured meshes. Using 3D texture mapping our first extension solves the longstanding problem of hardware-accelerated but accurate rendering of tetrahedral volume cells with arbitrary transfer functions. By employing 2D texture mapping our second extension realizes the hardware-accelerated rendering of multiple shaded isosurfaces within the PT algorithm without reconstructing the isosurfaces. Additionally, two methods are presented to combine projected tetrahedral volumes with isosurfaces. The time complexity of all our algorithms is linear in the number of tetrahedra and does neither depend on the number of isosurfaces nor on the employed transfer functions.
Recent years have seen an immense increase in the complexity of geometric data sets. Today's gigabyte-sized polygon models can no longer be completely loaded into the main memory of common desktop PCs. Unfortunately, current mesh formats, which were designed years ago when meshes were orders of magnitudes smaller, do not account for this. Using such formats to store large meshes is inefficient and complicates all subsequent processing. We describe a streaming format for polygon meshes that is simple enough to replace current offline mesh formats and is more suitable for representing large data sets. Furthermore, it is an ideal input and output format for I/O-efficient out-of-core algorithms that process meshes in a streaming, possibly pipelined, fashion. This paper chiefly concerns the underlying theory and the practical aspects of creating and working with this new representation. In particular, we describe desirable qualities for streaming meshes and methods for converting meshes from a traditional to a streaming format. A central theme of this paper is the issue of coherent and compatible layouts of the mesh vertices and polygons. We present metrics and diagrams that characterize the coherence of a mesh layout and suggest appropriate strategies for improving its "streamability". To this end, we outline several out-of-core algorithms for reordering meshes with poor coherence, and present results for a menagerie of well known and generally incoherent surface meshes.
In the area of scientific visualization, input data sets are often very large. In visualization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in particular, input data sets today can surpass 100 Gbytes, and are expected to scale with the ability of supercomputers to generate them. Some visualization tools already partition large data sets into segments, and load appropriate segments as they are needed. However, this does not remove the problem for two reasons: 1) there are data sets for which even the individual segments are too large for the largest graphics workstations, 2) many practitioners do not have access to workstations with the memory capacity required to load even a segment, especially since the state-of-the-art visualization tools tend to be developed by researchers with much more powerful machines. When the size of the data that must be accessed is larger than the size of memory, some form of virtual memory is simply required. This may be by segmentation, paging, or by paged segments. The authors demonstrate that complete reliance on operating system virtual memory for out-of-core visualization leads to egregious performance. They then describe a paged segment system that they have implemented, and explore the principles of memory management that can be employed by the application for out-of-core visualization. They show that application control over some of these can significantly improve performance. They show that sparse traversal can be exploited by loading only those data actually required.
This paper presents a vision-based geometric alignment system for aligning the projectors in an arbitrarily large display wall. Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors.
Many traditional techniques for "looking inside" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, "in place" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.
The visualization of complex 3D images remains a challenge, a fact that is magnified by the difficulty to classify or segment volume data. In this paper, we introduce size-based transfer functions, which map the local scale of features to color and opacity. Features in a data set with similar or identical scalar values can be classified based on their relative size. We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are 3D fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel. We present a mechanism for obtaining these scale fields at interactive rates, through a continuous scale-space analysis and a set of detection filters. Through a number of examples, we show that size-based transfer functions can improve classification and enhance volume rendering techniques, such as maximum intensity projection. The ability to classify objects based on local size at interactive rates proves to be a powerful method for complex data exploration.

Two basic principles for interactive visualization of high-dimensional data-focusing and linking-are discussed. Focusing techniques may involve selecting subsets, dimension reduction, or some more general manipulation of the layout information on the page or screen. A consequent of focusing is that each view only conveys partial information about the data and needs to be linked so that the information contained in individual views can be integrated into a coherent image of the data as a whole. Examples are given of how graphical data analysis methods based on focusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic information systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper presents a seed placement strategy for streamlines based on flow features in the dataset. The primary goal of our seeding strategy is to capture flow patterns in the vicinity of critical points in the flow field, even as the density of streamlines is reduced. Secondary goals are to place streamlines such that there is sufficient coverage in non-critical regions, and to vary the streamline placements and lengths so that the overall presentation is aesthetically pleasing (avoid clustering of streamlines, avoid sharp discontinuities across several streamlines, etc.). The procedure is straightforward and non-iterative. First, critical points are identified. Next, the flow field is segmented into regions, each containing a single critical point. The critical point in each region is then seeded with a template depending on the type of critical point. Finally, additional seed points are randomly distributed around the field using a Poisson disk distribution to minimize closely spaced seed points. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not miss the features around critical points. Since the strategy is not image-guided, and hence not view dependent, significant savings are possible when examining flow fields from different viewpoints, especially for 3D flow fields.
This paper introduces a concept for automatic focusing on features within a volumetric data set. The user selects a focus, i.e., object of interest, from a set of pre-defined features. Our system automatically determines the most expressive view on this feature. A characteristic viewpoint is estimated by a novel information-theoretic framework which is based on the mutual information measure. Viewpoints change smoothly by switching the focus from one feature to another one. This mechanism is controlled by changes in the importance distribution among features in the volume. The highest importance is assigned to the feature in focus. Apart from viewpoint selection, the focusing mechanism also steers visual emphasis by assigning a visually more prominent representation. To allow a clear view on features that are normally occluded by other parts of the volume, the focusing for example incorporates cut-away views
A probe for the interactive visualization of flow fields is presented. The probe can be used to visualize many characteristics of the flow in detail for a small region in the data set. The velocity and the local change of velocity (the velocity gradient tensor) are visualized by a set of geometric primitives. To this end, the velocity gradient tensor is transformed to a local coordinate frame, and decomposed into components parallel with and perpendicular to the flow. These components are visualized as geometric objects with an intuitively meaningful interpretation. An implementation is presented which shows that this probe is a useful tool for flow visualization.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We propose methods to accelerate texture-based volume rendering by skipping invisible voxels. We partition the volume into sub-volumes, each containing voxels with similar properties. Sub-volumes composed of only voxels mapped to empty by the transfer function are skipped. To render the adaptively partitioned sub-volumes in visibility order, we reorganize them into an orthogonal BSP tree. We also present an algorithm that computes incrementally the intersection of the volume with the slicing planes, which avoids the overhead of the intersection and texture coordinates computation introduced by the partitioning. Rendering with empty space skipping is 2 to 5 times faster than without it. To skip occluded voxels, we introduce the concept of orthogonal opacity map, that simplifies the transformation between the volume coordinates and the opacity map coordinates, which is intensively used for occlusion detection. The map is updated efficiently by the GPU. The sub-volumes are then culled and clipped against the opacity map. We also present a method that adaptively adjusts the optimal number of the opacity map updates. With occlusion clipping, about 60% of non-empty voxels can be skipped and an additional 80% speedup on average is gained for iso-surface-like rendering.
The Morse-Smale (MS) complex has proven to be a useful tool in extracting and visualizing features from scalar-valued data. However, efficient computation of the MS complex for large scale data remains a challenging problem. We describe a new algorithm and easily extensible framework for computing MS complexes for large scale data of any dimension where scalar values are given at the vertices of a closure-finite and weak topology (CW) complex, therefore enabling computation on a wide variety of meshes such as regular grids, simplicial meshes, and adaptive multiresolution (AMR) meshes. A new divide-and-conquer strategy allows for memory-efficient computation of the MS complex and simplification on-the-fly to control the size of the output. In addition to being able to handle various data formats, the framework supports implementation-specific optimizations, for example, for regular data. We present the complete characterization of critical point cancellations in all dimensions. This technique enables the topology based analysis of large data on off-the-shelf computers. In particular we demonstrate the first full computation of the MS complex for a 1 billion/1024<sup>3</sup>node grid on a laptop computer with 2 Gb memory.
Presents a new method for adaptive surface meshing and triangulation which controls the local level-of-detail of the surface approximation by local spectral estimates. These estimates are determined by a wavelet representation of the surface data. The basic idea is to decompose the initial data set by means of an orthogonal or semi-orthogonal tensor product wavelet transform (WT) and to analyze the resulting coefficients. In surface regions where the partial energy of the resulting coefficients is low, the polygonal approximation of the surface can be performed with larger triangles without losing too much fine-grain detail. However, since the localization of the WT is bound by the Heisenberg principle, the meshing method has to be controlled by the detail signals rather than directly by the coefficients. The dyadic scaling of the WT stimulated us to build a hierarchical meshing algorithm which transforms the initially regular data grid into a quadtree representation by rejection of unimportant mesh vertices. The optimum triangulation of the resulting quadtree cells is carried out by selection from a look-up table. The tree grows recursively, as controlled by the detail signals, which are computed from a modified inverse WT. In order to control the local level-of-detail, we introduce a new class of wavelet space filters acting as "magnifying glasses" on the data.
A technique is presented for the layout of high dimensional data in a low dimensional space. This technique builds upon the force based methods that have been used previously to make visualisations of various types of data such as bibliographies and sets of software modules. The canonical force based model, related to solutions of the N body problem, has a computational complexity of O(N/sup 2/) per iteration. The paper presents a stochastically based algorithm of linear complexity per iteration which produces good layouts, has low overhead, and is easy to implement. Its performance and accuracy are discussed, in particular with regard to the data to which it is applied. Experience with application to bibliographic and time series data, which may have a dimensionality in the tens of thousands, is described.
We describe an efficient technique for out-of-core management and interactive rendering of planet sized textured terrain surfaces. The technique, called planet-sized batched dynamic adaptive meshes (P-BDAM), extends the BDAM approach by using as basic primitive a general triangulation of points on a displaced triangle. The proposed framework introduces several advances with respect to the state of the art: thanks to a batched host-to-graphics communication model, we outperform current adaptive tessellation solutions in terms of rendering speed; we guarantee overall geometric continuity, exploiting programmable graphics hardware to cope with the accuracy issues introduced by single precision floating points; we exploit a compressed out of core representation and speculative prefetching for hiding disk latency during rendering of out-of-core data; we efficiently construct high quality simplified representations with a novel distributed out of core simplification algorithm working on a standard PC network.
This paper discusses strategies for effectively portraying 3D flow using volume line integral convolution. Issues include defining an appropriate input texture, clarifying the distinct identities and relative depths of the advected texture elements, and selectively highlighting regions of interest in both the input and output volumes. Apart from offering insights into the greater potential of 3D LIC as a method for effectively representing flow in a volume, a principal contribution of this work is the suggestion of a technique for generating and rendering 3D visibility-impeding "halos" that can help to intuitively indicate the presence of depth discontinuities between contiguous elements in a projection and thereby clarify the 3D spatial organization of elements in the flow. The proposed techniques are applied to the visualization of a hot, supersonic, laminar jet exiting into a colder, subsonic coflow.
A description is given of a software system, TOPO, that numerically analyzes and graphically displays topological aspects of a three-dimensional vector field, v, to produce a single, relatively simple picture that characterizes v. The topology of v considered consists of its critical points (where v=0), their invariant manifolds, and the integral curves connecting these invariant manifolds. The field in the neighborhood of each critical point is approximated by the Taylor expansion. The coefficients of the first nonzero term of the Taylor expansion around a critical point are the 3*3 matrix Delta v. Critical points are classified by examining Delta v's eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of Delta v span the invariant manifolds of the linearized field around a critical point. Curves integrated from initial points on the eigenvectors a small distance from a critical point connect with other critical points (or the boundary) to complete the topology. One class of critical surfaces that is important in computational fluid dynamics is analyzed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a novel method to extract iso-surfaces from distance volumes. It generates high quality semi-regular multiresolution meshes of arbitrary topology. Our technique proceeds in two stages. First, a very coarse mesh with guaranteed topology is extracted. Subsequently an iterative multi-scale force-based solver refines the initial mesh into a semi-regular mesh with geometrically adaptive sampling rate and good aspect ratio triangles. The coarse mesh extraction is performed using a new approach we call surface wavefront propagation. A set of discrete iso-distance ribbons are rapidly built and connected while respecting the topology of the iso-surface implied by the data. Subsequent multi-scale refinement is driven by a simple force-based solver designed to combine good iso-surface fit and high quality sampling through reparameterization. In contrast to the Marching Cubes technique our output meshes adapt gracefully to the iso-surface geometry, have a natural multiresolution structure and good aspect ratio triangles, as demonstrated with a number of examples.
One of the reasons that topological methods have a limited popularity for the visualization of complex 3D flow fields is the fact that such topological structures contain a number of separating stream surfaces. Since these stream surfaces tend to hide each other as well as other topological features, for complex 3D topologies the visualizations become cluttered and hardly interpretable. This paper proposes to use particular stream lines called saddle connectors instead of separating stream surfaces and to depict single surfaces only on user demand. We discuss properties and computational issues of saddle connectors and apply these methods to complex flow data. We show that the use of saddle connectors makes topological skeletons available as a valuable visualization tool even for topologically complex 3D flow data.
Volume rendered imagery often includes a barrage of 3D information like shape, appearance and topology of complex structures, and it thus quickly overwhelms the user. In particular, when focusing on a specific region a user cannot observe the relationship between various structures unless he has a mental picture of the entire data. In this paper we present ClearView, a GPU-based, interactive framework for texture-based volume ray-casting that allows users which do not have the visualization skills for this mental exercise to quickly obtain a picture of the data in a very intuitive and user-friendly way. ClearView is designed to enable the user to focus on particular areas in the data while preserving context information without visual clutter. ClearView does not require additional feature volumes as it derives any features in the data from image information only. A simple point-and-click interface enables the user to interactively highlight structures in the data. ClearView provides an easy to use interface to complex volumetric data as it only uses transparency in combination with a few specific shaders to convey focus and context information
We present a framework to extract mesh features from unstructured two-manifold surfaces. Our method computes a collection of piecewise linear curves describing the salient features of surfaces, such as edges and ridge lines. We extend these basic techniques to a multiresolution setting which improves the quality of the results and accelerates the extraction process. The extraction process is semi-automatic, that is, the user is required to input a few control parameters and to select the operators to be applied to the input surface. Our mesh feature extraction algorithm can be used as a preprocessor for a variety of applications in geometric modeling including mesh fairing, subdivision and simplification.
We present a novel approach for interactive view-dependent rendering of massive models. Our algorithm combines view-dependent simplification, occlusion culling, and out-of-core rendering. We represent the model as a clustered hierarchy of progressive meshes (CHPM). We use the cluster hierarchy for coarse-grained selective refinement and progressive meshes for fine-grained local refinement. We present an out-of-core algorithm for computation of a CHPM that includes cluster decomposition, hierarchy generation, and simplification. We make use of novel cluster dependencies in preprocess to generate crack-free, drastic simplifications at runtime. The clusters are used for occlusion culling and out-of-core rendering. We add a frame of latency to the rendering pipeline to fetch newly visible clusters from the disk and to avoid stalls. The CHPM reduces the refinement cost for view-dependent rendering by more than an order of magnitude as compared to a vertex hierarchy. We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC. We can render massive CAD, isosurface, and scanned models, consisting of tens or a few hundreds of millions of triangles at 10-35 frames per second with little loss in image quality.
Within biological systems, water molecules undergo continuous stochastic Brownian motion. The diffusion rate can give clues to the structure of the underlying tissues. In some tissues, the rate is anisotropic. Diffusion-rate images can be calculated from diffusion-weighted MRI. A 2D diffusion tensor image (DTI) and an associated anatomical scalar field define seven values at each spatial location. We present two new methods for visually representing DTIs. The first method displays an array of ellipsoids, where the shape of each ellipsoid represents one tensor value. The ellipsoids are all normalized to approximately the same size so that they can be displayed simultaneously in context. The second method uses concepts from oil painting to represent the seven-valued data with multiple layers of varying brush strokes. Both methods successfully display most or all of the information in DTIs and provide exploratory methods for understanding them. The ellipsoid method has a simpler interpretation and explanation than the painting-motivated method; the painting-motivated method displays more of the information and is easier to read quantatively. We demonstrate the methods on images of the mouse spinal cord. The visualizations show significant differences between spinal cords from mice suffering from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and spinal cords from wild-type mice. The differences are consistent with differences shown histologically and suggest that our new non-invasive imaging methodology and visualization of the results could have early diagnostic value for neurodegenerative diseases.
The ability to identify and present the most essential aspects of time-varying data is critically important in many areas of science and engineering. This paper introduces an importance-driven approach to time-varying volume data visualization for enhancing that ability. By conducting a block-wise analysis of the data in the joint feature-temporal space, we derive an importance curve for each data block based on the formulation of conditional entropy from information theory. Each curve characterizes the local temporal behavior of the respective block, and clustering the importance curves of all the volume blocks effectively classifies the underlying data. Based on different temporal trends exhibited by importance curves and their clustering results, we suggest several interesting and effective visualization techniques to reveal the important aspects of time-varying data.
For high quality rendering of objects segmented from tomographic volume data the precise location of the boundaries of adjacent objects in subvoxel resolution is required. We describe a new method that determines the membership of a given sample point to an object by reclassifying the sample point using interpolation of the original intensity values and searching for the best fitting object in the neighbourhood. Using a ray-casting approach we then compute the surface location between successive sample points along the viewing-ray by interpolation or bisection. The accurate calculation of the object boundary enables a much more precise computation of the gray-level-gradient yielding the surface normal. Our new approach significantly improves the quality of reconstructed and shaded surfaces and reduces aliasing artifacts for animations and magnified views. We illustrate the results on different cases including the Visible-Human-Data, where we achieve nearly photo-realistic images.
In the traditional volume visualization paradigm, the user specifies a transfer function that assigns each scalar value to a color and opacity by defining an opacity and a color map function. The transfer function has two limitations. First, the user must define curves based on histogram and value rather than seeing and working with the volume itself. Second, the transfer function is inflexible in classifying regions of interest, where values at a voxel such as intensity and gradient are used to differentiate material, not talking into account additional properties such as texture and position. We describe an intuitive user interface for specifying the classification functions that consists of the users painting directly on sample slices of the volume. These painted regions are used to automatically define high-dimensional classification functions that can be implemented in hardware for interactive rendering. The classification of the volume is iteratively improved as the user paints samples, allowing intuitive and efficient viewing of materials of interest.
Vector field visualization remains a difficult task. Many local and global visualization methods for vector fields such as flow data exist, but they usually require extensive user experience on setting the visualization parameters in order to produce images communicating the desired insight. We present a visualization method that produces simplified but suggestive images of the vector field automatically, based on a hierarchical clustering of the input data. The resulting clusters are then visualized with straight or curved arrow icons. The presented method has a few parameters with which users can produce various simplified vector field visualizations that communicate different insights on the vector data.
Optimal viewpoint selection is an important task because it considerably influences the amount of information contained in the 2D projected images of 3D objects, and thus dominates their first impressions from a psychological point of view. Although several methods have been proposed that calculate the optimal positions of viewpoints especially for 3D surface meshes, none has been done for solid objects such as volumes. This paper presents a new method of locating such optimal viewpoints when visualizing volumes using direct volume rendering. The major idea behind our method is to decompose an entire volume into a set of feature components, and then find a globally optimal viewpoint by finding a compromise between locally optimal viewpoints for the components. As the feature components, the method employs interval volumes and their combinations that characterize the topological transitions of isosurfaces according to the scalar field. Furthermore, opacity transfer functions are also utilized to assign different weights to the decomposed components so that users can emphasize features of specific interest in the volumes. Several examples of volume datasets together with their optimal positions of viewpoints are exhibited in order to demonstrate that the method can effectively guide naive users to find optimal projections of volumes.
The recently introduced notion of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent to characterize Coherent Lagrangian Structures provides a powerful framework for the visualization and analysis of complex technical flows. Its definition is simple and intuitive, and it has a deep theoretical foundation. While the application of this approach seems straightforward in theory, the associated computational cost is essentially prohibitive. Due to the Lagrangian nature of this technique, a huge number of particle paths must be computed to fill the space-time flow domain. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the adaptive computation of FTLE fields in two and three dimensions that significantly reduces the number of required particle paths. Furthermore, for three-dimensional flows, we show on several examples that meaningful results can be obtained by restricting the analysis to a well-chosen plane intersecting the flow domain. Finally, we examine some of the visualization aspects of FTLE-based methods and introduce several new variations that help in the analysis of specific aspects of a flow.
We propose an elementary operation on a pair of vector fields as a building block for defining and computing global line-type features of vector or scalar fields. While usual feature definitions often are procedural and therefore implicit, our operator allows precise mathematical definitions. It can serve as a basis for comparing feature definitions and for reuse of algorithms and implementations. Applications focus on vortex core methods.
The growing availability of massive polygonal models, and the inability of most existing visualization tools to work with such data, has created a pressing need for memory-efficient methods capable of simplifying very large meshes. In this paper, we present a method for performing adaptive simplification of polygonal meshes that are too large to fit in-core. Our algorithm performs two passes over an input mesh. In the first pass, the model is quantized using a uniform grid, and surface information is accumulated in the form of quadrics and dual quadrics. This sampling is then used to construct a BSP-tree in which the partitioning planes are determined by the dual quadrics. In the final pass, the original vertices are clustered using the BSP-tree, yielding an adaptive approximation of the original mesh. The BSP-tree describes a natural simplification hierarchy, making it possible to generate a progressive transmission and construct level-of-detail representations. In this way, the algorithm provides some of the features associated with more expensive edge contraction methods while maintaining greater computational efficiency. In addition to performing adaptive simplification, our algorithm exhibits output-sensitive memory requirements and allows fine control over the size of the simplified mesh.
When a heavy fluid is placed above a light fluid, tiny vertical perturbations in the interface create a characteristic structure of rising bubbles and falling spikes known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have received much attention over the past half-century because of their importance in understanding many natural and man-made phenomena, ranging from the rate of formation of heavy elements in supernovae to the design of capsules for Inertial Confinement Fusion. We present a new approach to analyze Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in which we extract a hierarchical segmentation of the mixing envelope surface to identify bubbles and analyze analogous segmentations of fields on the original interface plane. We compute meaningful statistical information that reveals the evolution of topological features and corroborates the observations made by scientists. We also use geometric tracking to follow the evolution of single bubbles and highlight merge/split events leading to the formation of the large and complex structures characteristic of the later stages. In particular we (i) Provide a formal definition of a bubble; (ii) Segment the envelope surface to identify bubbles; (iii) Provide a multi-scale analysis technique to produce statistical measures of bubble growth; (iv) Correlate bubble measurements with analysis of fields on the interface plane; (v) Track the evolution of individual bubbles over time. Our approach is based on the rigorous mathematical foundations of Morse theory and can be applied to a more general class of applications
Fiber tracking is a standard approach for the visualization of the results of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). If fibers are reconstructed and visualized individually through the complete white matter, the display gets easily cluttered making it difficult to get insight in the data. Various clustering techniques have been proposed to automatically obtain bundles that should represent anatomical structures, but it is unclear which clustering methods and parameter settings give the best results. We propose a framework to validate clustering methods for white-matter fibers. Clusters are compared with a manual classification which is used as a ground truth. For the quantitative evaluation of the methods, we developed a new measure to assess the difference between the ground truth and the clusterings. The measure was validated and calibrated by presenting different clusterings to physicians and asking them for their judgement. We found that the values of our new measure for different clusterings match well with the opinions of physicians. Using this framework, we have evaluated different clustering algorithms, including shared nearest neighbor clustering, which has not been used before for this purpose. We found that the use of hierarchical clustering using single-link and a fiber similarity measure based on the mean distance between fibers gave the best results.
In this work we present a method for speeding the process of volume animation. It exploits coherency between consecutive images to shorten the path rays take through the volume. Rays are provided with the information needed to leap over the empty space and commence volume traversal at the vicinity of meaningful data. The algorithm starts by projecting the volume onto a C-buffer (coordinates-buffer) which stores the object-space coordinates of the first non-empty voxel visible from a pixel. Following a change in the viewing parameters, the C-buffer is transformed accordingly. Next, coordinates that possibly became hidden are discarded. The remaining values serve as an estimate of the point where the new rays should start their volume traversal. This method does not require 3-D preprocessing and does not suffer from any image degradation. It can be combined with existing acceleration techniques and can support any ray traversal algorithm and material modeling scheme.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a novel out-of-core technique for the interactive computation of isosurfaces from volume data. Our algorithm minimizes the main memory and disk space requirements on the visualization workstation, while speeding up isosurface extraction queries. Our overall approach is a two-level indexing scheme. First, by our meta-cell technique, we partition the original dataset into clusters of cells, called meta-cells. Secondly, we produce meta-intervals associated with the meta-cells, and build an indexing data structure on the meta-intervals. We separate the cell information, kept only in meta-cells on disk, from the indexing structure, which is also on disk and only contains pointers to meta-cells. Our meta-cell technique is an I/O-efficient approach for computing a k-d-tree-like partition of the dataset. Our indexing data structure, the binary blocked I/O interval tree, is a new I/O-optimal data structure to perform stabbing queries that report from a set of meta-intervals (or intervals) those containing a query value q. Our tree is simpler to implement, and is also more space-efficient in practice than existing structures. To perform an isosurface query, we first query the indexing structure, and then use the reported meta-cell pointers to read from disk the active meta-cells intersected by the isosurface. The isosurface itself can then be generated from active meta-cells. Rather than being a single cost indexing approach, our technique exhibits a smooth trade-off between query time and disk space.
A survey of graphics developers on the issue of texture mapping hardware for volume rendering would most likely find that the vast majority of them view limited texture memory as one of the most serious drawbacks of an otherwise fine technology. In this paper, we propose a compression scheme for static and time-varying volumetric data sets based on vector quantization that allows us to circumvent this limitation. We describe a hierarchical quantization scheme that is based on a multiresolution covariance analysis of the original field. This allows for the efficient encoding of large-scale data sets, yet providing a mechanism to exploit temporal coherence in non-stationary fields. We show, that decoding and rendering the compressed data stream can be done on the graphics chip using programmable hardware. In this way, data transfer between the CPU and the graphics processing unit (GPU) can be minimized thus enabling flexible and memory efficient real-time rendering options. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating interactive renditions of Gigabyte data sets at reasonable fidelity on commodity graphics hardware.
This paper presents a method for filtered ridge extraction based on adaptive mesh refinement. It is applicable in situations where the underlying scalar field can be refined during ridge extraction. This requirement is met by the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures which is based on trajectories started at arbitrary sampling grids that are independent of the underlying vector field. The Lagrangian coherent structures are extracted as ridges in finite Lyapunov exponent fields computed from these grids of trajectories. The method is applied to several variants of finite Lyapunov exponents, one of which is newly introduced. High computation time due to the high number of required trajectories is a main drawback when computing Lyapunov exponents of 3-dimensional vector fields. The presented method allows a substantial speed-up by avoiding the seeding of trajectories in regions where no ridges are present or do not satisfy the prescribed filter criteria such as a minimum finite Lyapunov exponent.
This paper is aimed at the exploratory visualization of networks where there is a strength or weight associated with each link, and makes use of any hierarchy present on the nodes to aid the investigation of large networks. It describes a method of placing nodes on the plane that gives meaning to their relative positions. The paper discusses how linking and interaction principles aid the user in the exploration. Two examples are given; one of electronic mail communication over eight months within a department, another concerned with changes to a large section of a computer program.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper presents a technique for performing volume morphing between two volumetric datasets in the wavelet domain. The idea is to decompose the volumetric datasets into a set of frequency bands, apply smooth interpolation to each band, and reconstruct to form the morphed model. In addition, a technique for establishing a suitable correspondence among object voxels is presented. The combination of these two techniques results in a smooth transition between the two datasets and produces morphed volume with fewer high frequency distortions than those obtained from spatial domain volume morphing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper describes some fundamental issues for robust implementations of progressively refined tetrahedralizations generated through sequences of edge collapses. We address the definition of appropriate cost functions and explain on various tests which are necessary to preserve the consistency of the mesh when collapsing edges. Although considered a special case of progressive simplicial complexes (J. Popovic and H. Hoppe, 1997), the results of our method are of high practical importance and can be used in many different applications, such as finite element meshing, scattered data interpolation, or rendering of unstructured volume data.
HyperSlice is a new method for the visualization of scalar functions of many variables. With this method the multi-dimensional function is presented in a simple and easy to understand way in which all dimensions are treated identically. The central concept is the representation of a multi-dimensional function as a matrix of orthogonal two-dimensional slices. These two-dimensional slices lend themselves very well to interaction via direct manipulation, due to a one to one relation between screen space and variable space. Several interaction techniques, for navigation, the location of maxima, and the use of user-defined paths, are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present an algorithm for haptic display of moderately complex polygonal models with a six degree of freedom (DOF) force feedback device. We make use of incremental algorithms for contact determination between convex primitives. The resulting contact information is used for calculating the restoring forces and torques and thereby used to generate a sense of virtual touch. To speed up the computation, our approach exploits a combination of geometric locality, temporal coherence, and predictive methods to compute object-object contacts at kHz rates. The algorithm has been implemented and interfaced with a 6-DOF PHANToM Premium 1.5. We demonstrate its performance on force display of the mechanical interaction between moderately complex geometric structures that can be decomposed into convex primitives.
The size and resolution of volume datasets in science and medicine are increasing at a rate much greater than the resolution of the screens used to view them. This limits the amount of data that can be viewed simultaneously, potentially leading to a loss of overall context of the data when the user views or zooms into a particular area of interest. We propose a focus+context framework that uses various standard and advanced magnification lens rendering techniques to magnify the features of interest, while compressing the remaining volume regions without clipping them away completely. Some of these lenses can be interactively configured by the user to specify the desired magnification patterns, while others are feature-adaptive. All our lenses are accelerated on the GPU. They allow the user to interactively manage the available screen area, dedicating more area to the more resolution-important features.
Triangle decimation techniques reduce the number of triangles in a mesh, typically to improve interactive rendering performance or reduce data storage and transmission requirements. Most of these algorithms are designed to preserve the original topology of the mesh. Unfortunately, this characteristic is a strong limiting factor in overall reduction capability, since objects with a large number of holes or other topological constraints cannot be effectively reduced. The author presents an algorithm that yields a guaranteed reduction level, modifying topology as necessary to achieve the desired result. In addition, the algorithm is based on a fast local decimation technique, and its operations can be encoded for progressive storage, transmission, and reconstruction. He describes the new progressive decimation algorithm, introduces mesh splitting operations and shows how they can be encoded as a progressive mesh. He also demonstrates the utility of the algorithm on models ranging in size from 1,132 to 1.68 million triangles and reduction ratios of up to 200:1.
We introduce a technique to visualize the gradual evolutionary change of the shapes of living things as a morph between known three-dimensional shapes. Given geometric computer models of anatomical shapes for some collection of specimens - here the skulls of the some of the extant members of a family of monkeys - an evolutionary tree for the group implies a hypothesis about the way in which the shape changed through time. We use a statistical model which expresses the value of some continuous variable at an internal point in the tree as a weighted average of the values at the leaves. The framework of geometric morphometrics can then be used to define a shape-space, based on the correspondences of landmark points on the surfaces, within which these weighted averages can be realized as actual surfaces. Our software provides tools for performing and visualizing such an analysis in three dimensions. Beginning with laser range scans of crania, we use our landmark editor to interactively place landmark points on the surface. We use these to compute a "tree-morph" that smoothly interpolates the shapes across the tree. Each intermediate shape in the morph is a linear combination of all of the input surfaces. We create a surface model for an intermediate shape by warping all the input meshes towards the correct shape and then blending them together. To do the blending, we compute a weighted average of their associated trivariate distance functions and then extract a surface from the resulting function. We implement this idea using the squared distance function, rather than the usual signed distance function, in a novel way.
Streamlines and stream surfaces are well known techniques for the visualization of fluid flow. For steady velocity fields, a streamline is the trace of a particle, and a stream surface is the trace of a curve. Here a new method is presented for the construction of stream surfaces. The central concept is the representation of a stream surface as an implicit surface f (x) = C. After the initial calculation of f a family of stream surfaces can be generated efficiently by varying C. The shapes of the originating curves are defined by the value of f at the boundary. Two techniques are presented for the calculation of f: one based on solving the convection equation, the other on backward tracing of the trajectories of grid points. The flow around objects is discussed separately. With this method irregular topologies of the originating curves and of the stream surfaces can be handled easily. Further, it can also be used for other visualization techniques, such as time surfaces and stream volumes. Finally, an effective method for the automatic placement of originating curves is presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper presents a novel method to extract vortical structures from 3D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) vector fields automatically. It discusses the underlying theory and some aspects of the implementation. Making use of higher-order derivatives, the method is able to locate bent vortices. In order to structure the recognition procedure, we distinguish locating the core line from calculating attributes of strength and quality. Results are presented on several flow fields from the field of turbomachinery.
We present a 3-D antialiasing algorithm for voxel-based geometric models. The technique band-limits the continuous object before sampling it at the desired 3-D raster resolution. By precomputing tables of filter values for different types and sizes of geometric objects, the algorithm is very efficient and has a complexity that is linear with the number of voxels generated. The algorithm not only creates voxel models which are free from object space aliasing, but it also incorporates the image space antialiasing information as part of the view independent voxel model. The resulting alias-free voxel models have been used to model synthetic scenes, for discrete ray tracing applications. The discrete ray-traced image is superior in quality to the image generated with a conventional surface-based ray tracer, since silhouettes of objects, shadows, and reflections appear smooth (jaggy-less). In addition, the alias-free models are also suitable for intermixing with sampled datasets, since they can be treated uniformly as one common data representation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors present a multiresolution framework, called Multi-Tetra framework, that approximates volume data with different levels-of-detail tetrahedra. The framework is generated through a recursive subdivision of the volume data and is represented by binary trees. Instead of using a certain level of the Multi-Tetra framework for approximation, an error-based model (EBM) is generated by recursively fusing a sequence of tetrahedra from different levels of the Multi-Tetra framework. The EBM significantly reduces the number of voxels required to model an object, while preserving the original topology. The approach provides continuous distribution of rendered intensity or generated isosurfaces along boundaries of different levels-of-detail thus solving the crack problem. The model supports typical rendering approaches, such as marching cubes, direct volume projection, and splatting. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the approach.
There are many applications that can benefit from the simultaneous display of multiple layers of data. The objective in these cases is to render the layered surfaces in a such way that the outer structures can be seen and seen through at the same time. The paper focuses on the particular application of radiation therapy treatment planning, in which physicians need to understand the three dimensional distribution of radiation dose in the context of patient anatomy. We describe a promising technique for communicating the shape and position of the transparent skin surface while at the same time minimally occluding underlying isointensity dose surfaces and anatomical objects: adding a sparse, opaque texture comprised of a small set of carefully chosen lines. We explain the perceptual motivation for explicitly drawing ridge and valley curves on a transparent surface, describe straightforward mathematical techniques for detecting and rendering these lines, and propose a small number of reasonably effective methods for selectively emphasizing the most perceptually relevant lines in the display.
Navigation through 3D spaces is required in many interactive graphics and virtual reality applications. The authors consider the subclass of situations in which a 2D device such as a mouse controls smooth movements among viewpoints for a "through the screen" display of a 3D world. Frequently, there is a poor match between the goal of such a navigation activity, the control device, and the skills of the average user. They propose a unified mathematical framework for incorporating context-dependent constraints into the generalized viewpoint generation problem. These designer-supplied constraint modes provide a middle ground between the triviality of a single camera animation path and the confusing excess freedom of common unconstrained control paradigms. They illustrate the approach with a variety of examples, including terrain models, interior architectural spaces, and complex molecules.
Virtualized reality is a modeling technique that constructs full 3D virtual representations of dynamic events from multiple video streams. Image-based stereo is used to compute a range image corresponding to each intensity image in each video stream. Each range and intensity image pair encodes the scene structure and appearance of the scene visible to the camera at that moment, and is therefore called a visible surface model (VSM). A single time instant of the dynamic event can be modeled as a collection of VSMs from different viewpoints, and the full event can be modeled as a sequence of static scenes-the 3D equivalent of video. Alternatively, the collection of VSMs at a single time can be fused into a global 3D surface model, thus creating a traditional virtual representation out of real world events. Global modeling has the added benefit of eliminating the need to hand-edit the range images to correct errors made in stereo, a drawback of previous techniques. Like image-based rendering models, these virtual representations can be used to synthesize nearly any view of the virtualized event. For this reason, the paper includes a detailed comparison of existing view synthesis techniques with the authors' own approach. In the virtualized representations, however, scene structure is explicitly represented and therefore easily manipulated, for example by adding virtual objects to (or removing virtualized objects from) the model without interfering with real event. Virtualized reality, then, is a platform not only for image-based rendering but also for 3D scene manipulation.
The sphere quadtree (SQT), which is based on the recursive subdivision of spherical triangles obtained by projecting the faces of an icosahedron onto a sphere, is discussed. Most databases for spherically distributed data are not structured in a manner consistent with their geometry. As a result, such databases possess undesirable artifacts, including the introduction of tears in the data when they are mapped onto a flat file system. Furthermore, it is difficult to make queries about the topological relationship among the data components without performing real arithmetic. The SQT eliminates some of these problems. The SQT allows the representation of data at multiple levels and arbitrary resolution. Efficient search strategies can be implemented for the selection of data to be rendered or analyzed by a specific technique. Geometric and topological consistency with the data are maintained.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Multi-triangulation (MT) is a general framework for managing the level-of-detail in large triangle meshes, which we have introduced in our previous work. In this paper, we describe an efficient implementation of an MT based on vertex decimation. We present general techniques for querying an MT, which are independent of a specific application, and which can be applied for solving problems, such as selective refinement, windowing, point location, and other spatial interference queries. We describe alternative data structures for encoding an MT, which achieve different trade-offs between space and performance. Experimental results are discussed.
Presents a conceptual framework and a process model for feature extraction and iconic visualization. Feature extraction is viewed as a process of data abstraction, which can proceed in multiple stages, and corresponding data abstraction levels. The features are represented by attribute sets, which play a key role in the visualization process. Icons are symbolic parametric objects, designed as visual representations of features. The attributes are mapped to the parameters (or degrees of freedom) of an icon. We describe some generic techniques to generate attribute sets, such as volume integrals and medial axis transforms. A simple but powerful modeling language was developed to create icons, and to link the attributes to the icon parameters. We present illustrative examples of iconic visualization created with the techniques described, showing the effectiveness of this approach.
Surface texturing aids the visualization of polygonal meshes by providing additional surface orientation cues and feature annotations. Such texturing is usually implemented via texture mapping, which is easier and more effective when the distortion of the mapping from the surface to the texture map is kept small. We have previously shown that distortion occurs when areas of high surface curvature are flattened into the texture map. By cutting the surface in these areas one can reduce texture map distortion at the expense of additional seam artifacts. This paper describes a faster technique for guiding a texture map seam through high distortion regions, while restricting the seam to regions of low visibility. This results in distortion reducing seams that are less visually distracting and take less time to compute. We have also observed that visibility considerations improve the speed of a recent method that adds cuts to reduce a surface genus.
Direct volume rendering is a commonly used technique in visualization applications. Many of these applications require sophisticated shading models to capture subtle lighting effects and characteristics of volumetric data and materials. Many common objects and natural phenomena exhibit visual quality that cannot be captured using simple lighting models or cannot be solved at interactive rates using more sophisticated methods. We present a simple yet effective interactive shading model which captures volumetric light attenuation effects to produce volumetric shadows and the subtle appearance of translucency. We also present a technique for volume displacement or perturbation that allows realistic interactive modeling of high frequency detail for real and synthetic volumetric data.
Modular visualization environments utilizing a data-flow execution model have become quite popular in recent years, especially those that incorporate visual programming tools. However, simplistic implementations of such an execution model are quite limited when applied to problems of realistic complexity, which negate the intuitive advantage of data-flow systems. This situation can be resolved by extending the execution model to incorporate a more complete and efficient programming infrastructure while still preserving the virtues of pure "data-flow". This approach has been used for the implementation of a general-purpose software package, IBM Visualization Data Explorer.
Exploded views are an illustration technique where an object is partitioned into several segments. These segments are displaced to reveal otherwise hidden detail. In this paper we apply the concept of exploded views to volumetric data in order to solve the general problem of occlusion. In many cases an object of interest is occluded by other structures. While transparency or cutaways can be used to reveal a focus object, these techniques remove parts of the context information. Exploded views, on the other hand, do not suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a force-based model: the volume is divided into a part configuration controlled by a number of forces and constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force causing the parts to arrange according to the given constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach allows for a wide variety of explosion-based visualizations including view-dependent explosions. Furthermore, we present a high-quality GPU-based volume ray casting algorithm for exploded views which allows rendering and interaction at several frames per second
Many sophisticated solutions have been proposed to reduce the geometric complexity of 3D meshes. A problem studied less often is how to preserve on a simplified mesh the detail (e.g., color, high frequency shape detail, scalar fields, etc.) which is encoded in the original mesh. We present a general approach for preserving detail on simplified meshes. The detail (or high frequency information) lost after simplification is encoded through texture or bump maps. The original contribution is that preservation is performed after simplification, by building set of triangular texture patches that are then packed in a single texture map. Each simplified mesh face is sampled to build the associated triangular texture patch; a new method for storing this set of texture patches into a standard rectangular texture is presented and discussed. Our detail preserving approach makes no assumptions about the simplification process adopted to reduce mesh complexity and allows highly efficient rendering. The solution is very general, allowing preservation of any attribute value defined on the high resolution mesh. We also describe an alternative application: the conversion of 3D models with 3D static procedural textures into standard 3D models with 2D textures.
Uncertainty or errors are introduced in fluid flow data as the data is acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity, especially near critical points in the flow field.
The process of visualization can be seen as a visual communication channel where the input to the channel is the raw data, and the output is the result of a visualization algorithm. From this point of view, we can evaluate the effectiveness of visualization by measuring how much information in the original data is being communicated through the visual communication channel. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic framework for flow visualization with a special focus on streamline generation. In our framework, a vector field is modeled as a distribution of directions from which Shannon's entropy is used to measure the information content in the field. The effectiveness of the streamlines displayed in visualization can be measured by first constructing a new distribution of vectors derived from the existing streamlines, and then comparing this distribution with that of the original data set using the conditional entropy. The conditional entropy between these two distributions indicates how much information in the original data remains hidden after the selected streamlines are displayed. The quality of the visualization can be improved by progressively introducing new streamlines until the conditional entropy converges to a small value. We describe the key components of our framework with detailed analysis, and show that the framework can effectively visualize 2D and 3D flow data.
In this paper we present a novel framework for direct volume rendering using a splatting approach based on elliptical Gaussian kernels. To avoid aliasing artifacts, we introduce the concept of a resampling filter combining a reconstruction with a low-pass kernel. Because of the similarity to Heckbert's EWA (elliptical weighted average) filter for texture mapping we call our technique EWA volume splatting. It provides high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring even with non-spherical kernels. Hence it is suitable for regular, rectilinear, and irregular volume data sets. Moreover, our framework introduces a novel approach to compute the footprint function. It facilitates efficient perspective projection of arbitrary elliptical kernels at very little additional cost. Finally, we show that EWA volume reconstruction kernels can be reduced to surface reconstruction kernels. This makes our splat primitive universal in reconstructing surface and volume data.
Presents a simple, robust and practical method for object simplification for applications where gradual elimination of high-frequency details is desired. This is accomplished by sampling and low-pass filtering the object into multi-resolution volume buffers and applying the marching cubes algorithm to generate a multi-resolution triangle-mesh hierarchy. Our method simplifies the genus of objects and can also help existing object simplification algorithms achieve better results. At each level of detail, a multi-layered mesh can be used for an optional and efficient antialiased rendering.
We present a technique for the illustrative rendering of 3D line data at interactive frame rates. We create depth-dependent halos around lines to emphasize tight line bundles while less structured lines are de-emphasized. Moreover, the depth-dependent halos combined with depth cueing via line width attenuation increase depth perception, extending techniques from sparse line rendering to the illustrative visualization of dense line data. We demonstrate how the technique can be used, in particular, for illustrating DTI fiber tracts but also show examples from gas and fluid flow simulations and mathematics as well as describe how the technique extends to point data. We report on an informal evaluation of the illustrative DTI fiber tract visualizations with domain experts in neurosurgery and tractography who commented positively about the results and suggested a number of directions for future work.
Simulating hand-drawn illustration techniques can succinctly express information in a manner that is communicative and informative. We present a framework for an interactive direct volume illustration system that simulates traditional stipple drawing. By combining the principles of artistic and scientific illustration, we explore several feature enhancement techniques to create effective, interactive visualizations of scientific and medical datasets. We also introduce a rendering mechanism that generates appropriate point lists at all resolutions during an automatic preprocess, and modifies rendering styles through different combinations of these feature enhancements. The new system is an effective way to interactively preview large, complex volume datasets in a concise, meaningful, and illustrative manner. Volume stippling is effective for many applications and provides a quick and efficient method to investigate volume models.
This paper presents a signed distance transform algorithm using graphics hardware, which computes the scalar valued function of the Euclidean distance to a given manifold of co-dimension one. If the manifold is closed and orientable, the distance has a negative sign on one side of the manifold and a positive sign on the other. Triangle meshes are considered for the representation of a two-dimensional manifold and the distance function is sampled on a regular Cartesian grid. In order to achieve linear complexity in the number of grid points, to each primitive we assign a simple polyhedron enclosing its Voronoi cell. Voronoi cells are known to contain exactly all points that lay closest to its corresponding primitive. Thus, the distance to the primitive only has to be computed for grid points inside its polyhedron. Although Voronoi cells partition space, the polyhedrons enclosing these cells do overlap. In regions where these overlaps occur, the minimum of all computed distances is assigned to a grid point. In order to speed up computations, points inside each polyhedron are determined by scan conversion of grid slices using graphics hardware. For this task, a fragment program is used to perform the nonlinear interpolation and minimization of distance values.
Artificial neural networks are computer software or hardware models inspired by the structure and behavior of neurons in the human nervous system. As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.
Large area tiled displays are gaining popularity for use in collaborative immersive virtual environments and scientific visualization. While recent work has addressed the issues of geometric registration, rendering architectures, and human interfaces, there has been relatively little work on photometric calibration in general, and photometric non-uniformity in particular. For example, as a result of differences in the photometric characteristics of projectors, the color and intensity of a large area display varies from place to place. Further, the imagery typically appears brighter at the regions of overlap between adjacent projectors. We analyze and classify the causes of photometric non-uniformity in a tiled display. We then propose a methodology for determining corrections designed to achieve uniformity, that can correct for the photometric variations across a tiled projector display in real time using per channel color look-up-tables (LUT).
The VolVis system has been developed to satisfy the diverse requirements of the volume visualization community by comfortably housing numerous visualization algorithms and methods within a consistent and well organized framework. The VolVis system is supported by a generalized abstract model which provides for both geometric and volumetric constructs. VolVis contains several rendering algorithms that span the speed versus accuracy continuum. A fast volume rendering algorithm has been developed, which is capable of exploiting existing graphics hardware without placing any viewing restrictions or compromising accuracy. In addition, VolVis includes a volumetric navigation facility, key-frame animation generator, quantitative analysis tools, and a generalized protocol for communicating with 3D input devices.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this paper we develop a new technique for tracing anatomical fibers from 3D tensor fields. The technique extracts salient tensor features using a local regularization technique that allows the algorithm to cross noisy regions and bridge gaps in the data. We applied the method to human brain DT-MRI data and recovered identifiable anatomical structures that correspond to the white matter brain-fiber pathways. The images in this paper are derived from a dataset having 121/spl times/88/spl times/60 resolution. We were able to recover fibers with less than the voxel size resolution by applying the regularization technique, i.e., using a priori assumptions about fiber smoothness. The regularization procedure is done through a moving least squares filter directly incorporated in the tracing algorithm.
Vector fields can present complex structural behavior, especially in turbulent computational fluid dynamics. The topological analysis of these data sets reduces the information, but one is usually still left with too many details for interpretation. In this paper, we present a simplification approach that removes pairs of critical points from the data set, based on relevance measures. In contrast to earlier methods, no grid changes are necessary, since the whole method uses small local changes of the vector values defining the vector field. An interpretation in terms of bifurcations underlines the continuous, natural flavor of the algorithm.
A new method for the synthesis of dense, vector-field aligned textures on curved surfaces is presented, called IBFVS. The method is based on image based flow visualization (IBFV). In IBFV two-dimensional animated textures are produced by defining each frame of a flow animation as a blend between a warped version of the previous image and a number of filtered white noise images. We produce flow aligned texture on arbitrary three-dimensional triangular meshes in the same spirit as the original method: texture is generated directly in image space. We show that IBFVS is efficient and effective. High performance (typically fifty frames or more per second) is achieved by exploiting graphics hardware. Also, IBFVS can easily be implemented and a variety of effects can be achieved. Applications are flow visualization and surface rendering. Specifically, we show how to visualize the wind field on the earth and how to render a dirty bronze bunny.
We present the definition and computational algorithms for a new class of surfaces which are dual to the isosurface produced by the widely used marching cubes (MC) algorithm. These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.
The paper presents an algorithm, UFLIC (Unsteady Flow LIC), to visualize vector data in unsteady flow fields. Using line integral convolution (LIC) as the underlying method, a new convolution algorithm is proposed that can effectively trace the flow's global features over time. The new algorithm consists of a time-accurate value depositing scheme and a successive feedforward method. The value depositing scheme accurately models the flow advection, and the successive feedforward method maintains the coherence between animation frames. The new algorithm can produce time-accurate, highly coherent flow animations to highlight global features in unsteady flow fields. CFD scientists, for the first time, are able to visualize unsteady surface flows using the algorithm.
Multiresolution methods are becoming increasingly important tools for the interactive visualization of very large data sets. Multiresolution isosurface visualization allows the user to explore volume data using simplified and coarse representations of the isosurface for overview images, and finer resolution in areas of high interest or when zooming into the data. Ideally, a coarse isosurface should have the same topological structure as the original. The topological genus of the isosurface is one important property which is often neglected in multiresolution algorithms. This results in uncontrolled topological changes which can occur whenever the level-of-detail is changed. The scope of this paper is to propose an efficient technique which allows preservation of topology as well as controlled topology simplification in multiresolution isosurface extraction.
We present a technique for direct visualization of unsteady flow on surfaces from computational fluid dynamics. The method generates dense representations of time-dependent vector fields with high spatio-temporal correlation using both Lagrangian-Eulerian advection and image based flow visualization as its foundation. While the 3D vector fields are associated with arbitrary triangular surface meshes, the generation and advection of texture properties is confined to image space. Frame rates of up to 20 frames per second are realized by exploiting graphics card hardware. We apply this algorithm to unsteady flow on boundary surfaces of, large, complex meshes from computational fluid dynamics composed of more than 250,000 polygons, dynamic meshes with time-dependent geometry and topology, as well as medical data.
In this paper we show how out-of-core mesh processing techniques can be adapted to perform their computations based on the new processing sequence paradigm (Isenburg, et al., 2003), using mesh simplification as an example. We believe that this processing concept will also prove useful for other tasks, such a parameterization, remeshing, or smoothing, for which currently only in-core solutions exist. A processing sequence represents a mesh as a particular interleaved ordering of indexed triangles and vertices. This representation allows streaming very large meshes through main memory while maintaining information about the visitation status of edges and vertices. At any time, only a small portion of the mesh is kept in-core, with the bulk of the mesh data residing on disk. Mesh access is restricted to a fixed traversal order, but full connectivity and geometry information is available for the active elements of the traversal. This provides seamless and highly efficient out-of-core access to very large meshes for algorithms that can adapt their computations to this fixed ordering. The two abstractions that are naturally supported by this representation are boundary-based and buffer-based processing. We illustrate both abstractions by adapting two different simplification methods to perform their computation using a prototype of our mesh processing sequence API. Both algorithms benefit from using processing sequences in terms of improved quality, more efficient execution, and smaller memory footprints.
The compression of geometric structures is a relatively new field of data compression. Since about 1995, several articles have dealt with the coding of meshes, using for most of them the following approach: the vertices of the mesh are coded in an order that partially contains the topology of the mesh. In the same time, some simple rules attempt to predict the position of each vertex from the positions of its neighbors that have been previously coded. We describe a compression algorithm whose principle is completely different: the coding order of the vertices is used to compress their coordinates, and then the topology of the mesh is reconstructed from the vertices. This algorithm achieves compression ratios that are slightly better than those of the currently available algorithms, and moreover, it allows progressive and interactive transmission of the meshes.
We introduce a simple but effective extension to the existing pure point rendering systems. Rather than using only points, we use both points and polygons to represent and render large mesh models. We start from triangles as leaf nodes and build up a hierarchical tree structure with intermediate nodes as points. During the rendering, the system determines whether to use a point (of a certain intermediate level node) or a triangle (of a leaf node) for display depending on the screen contribution of each node. While points are used to speedup the rendering of distant objects, triangles are used to ensure the quality of close objects. Our method can accelerate the rendering of large models, compromising little in image quality.
Volume rendering is a flexible technique for visualizing dense 3D volumetric datasets. A central element of volume rendering is the conversion between data values and observable quantities such as color and opacity. This process is usually realized through the use of transfer functions that are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. For multidimensional transfer functions applied to multivariate data, these lookup tables become prohibitively large. We propose the direct evaluation of a particular type of transfer functions based on a sum of Gaussians. Because of their simple form (in terms of number of parameters), these functions and their analytic integrals along line segments can be evaluated efficiently on current graphics hardware, obviating the need for precomputed lookup tables. We have adopted these transfer functions because they are well suited for classification based on a unique combination of multiple data values that localize features in the transfer function domain. We apply this technique to the visualization of several multivariate datasets (CT, cryosection) that are difficult to classify and render accurately at interactive rates using traditional approaches.
Professional designers and artists are quite cognizant of the rules that guide the design of effective color palettes, from both aesthetic and attention-guiding points of view. In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios. Our framework's use of principles rooted in color design with application for the illustration of features in pre-classified data distinguishes it from existing systems which target the exploration of continuous-range density data via perceptual color maps.
The authors consider the multi-triangulation, a general model for representing surfaces at variable resolution based on triangle meshes. They analyse characteristics of the model that make it effective for supporting basic operations such as extraction of a surface approximation, and point location. An interruptible algorithm for extracting a representation at a resolution variable over the surface is presented. Different heuristics for building the model are considered and compared. Results on both the construction and the extraction algorithm are presented.
We describe an algorithm for repairing polyhedral CAD models that have errors in their B-REP. Errors like cracks, degeneracies, duplication, holes and overlaps are usually introduced in solid models due to imprecise arithmetic, model transformations, designer errors, programming bugs, etc. Such errors often hamper further processing such as finite element analysis, radiosity computation and rapid prototyping. Our fault-repair algorithm converts an unordered collection of polygons to a shared-vertex representation to help eliminate errors. This is done by choosing, for each polygon edge, the most appropriate edge to unify it with. The two edges are then geometrically merged into one, by moving vertices. At the end of this process, each polygon edge is either coincident with another or is a boundary edge for a polygonal hole or a dangling wall and may be appropriately repaired. Finally, in order to allow user-inspection of the automatic corrections, we produce a visualization of the repair and let the user mark the corrections that conflict with the original design intent. A second iteration of the correction algorithm then produces a repair that is commensurate with the intent. This, by involving the users in a feedback loop, we are able to refine the correction to their satisfaction.
Direct volume rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a "sensitivity lens" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.
We describe a pipeline of image processing steps for deriving symbolic models of vascular structures from radiological data which reflect the branching pattern and diameter of vessels. For the visualization of these symbolic models, concatenated truncated cones are smoothly blended at branching points. We put emphasis on the quality of the visualizations which is achieved by anti-aliasing operations in different stages of the visualization. The methods presented are referred to as HQVV (high quality vessel visualization). Scalable techniques are provided to explore vascular structures of different orders of magnitude. The hierarchy as well as the diameter of the branches of vascular systems are used to restrict visualizations to relevant subtrees and to emphasize parts of vascular systems. Our research is inspired by clear visualizations in textbooks and is targeted toward medical education and therapy planning. We describe the application of vessel visualization techniques for liver surgery planning. For this application it is crucial to recognize the morphology and branching pattern of vascular systems as well as the basic spatial relations between vessels and other anatomic structures.
Many volume filtering operations used for image enhancement, data processing or feature detection can be written in terms of three-dimensional convolutions. It is not possible to yield interactive frame rates on todays hardware when applying such convolutions on volume data using software filter routines. As modern graphics workstations have the ability to render two-dimensional convoluted images to the frame buffer, this feature can be used to accelerate the process significantly. This way generic 3D convolution can be added as a powerful tool in interactive volume visualization toolkits.
We propose a novel algorithm for placement of streamlines from two-dimensional steady vector or direction fields. Our method consists of placing one streamline at a time by numerical integration starting at the furthest away from all previously placed streamlines. Such a farthest point seeding strategy leads to high quality placements by favoring long streamlines, while retaining uniformity with the increasing density. Our greedy approach generates placements of comparable quality with respect to the optimization approach from Turk and Banks, while being 200 times faster. Simplicity, robustness as well as efficiency is achieved through the use of a Delaunay triangulation to model the streamlines, address proximity queries and determine the biggest voids by exploiting the empty circle property. Our method handles variable density and extends to multiresolution.
Many techniques have been proposed to show uncertainty in data visualizations. However, very little is known about their effectiveness in conveying meaningful information. In this paper, we present a user study that evaluates the perception of uncertainty amongst four of the most commonly used techniques for visualizing uncertainty in one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. The techniques evaluated are traditional errorbars, scaled size of glyphs, color-mapping on glyphs, and color-mapping of uncertainty on the data surface. The study uses generated data that was designed to represent the systematic and random uncertainty components. Twenty-seven users performed two types of search tasks and two types of counting tasks on 1D and 2D datasets. The search tasks involved finding data points that were least or most uncertain. The counting tasks involved counting data features or uncertainty features. A 4 times 4 full-factorial ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between the techniques used and the type of tasks assigned for both datasets indicating that differences in performance between the four techniques depended on the type of task performed. Several one-way ANOVAs were computed to explore the simple main effects. Bonferronni's correction was used to control for the family-wise error rate for alpha-inflation. Although we did not find a consistent order among the four techniques for all the tasks, there are several findings from the study that we think are useful for uncertainty visualization design. We found a significant difference in user performance between searching for locations of high and searching for locations of low uncertainty. Errorbars consistently underperformed throughout the experiment. Scaling the size of glyphs and color-mapping of the surface performed reasonably well. The efficiency of most of these techniques were highly dependent on the tasks performed. We believe that these findings can be used in future uncertainty visualization design. In addition, the framework developed in this user study presents a structured approach to evaluate uncertainty visualization techniques, as well as provides a basis for future research in uncertainty visualization.
Topology analysis of plane, turbulent vector fields results in visual clutter caused by critical points indicating vortices of finer and finer scales. A simplification can be achieved by merging critical points within a prescribed radius into higher order critical points. After building clusters containing the singularities to merge, the method generates a piecewise linear representation of the vector field in each cluster containing only one (higher order) singularity. Any visualization method can be applied to the result after this process. Using different maximal distances for the critical points to be merged results in a hierarchy of simplified vector fields that can be used for analysis on different scales.
Transfer function design is an integrated component in volume visualization and data exploration. The common trial-and-error approach for transfer function searching is a very difficult and time consuming process. A goal oriented and parameterized transfer function model is therefore crucial in guiding the transfer function searching process for better and more meaningful visualization results. The paper presents an image based transfer function model that integrates 3D image processing tools into the volume visualization pipeline to facilitate the search for an image based transfer function in volume data visualization and exploration. The model defines a transfer function as a sequence of 3D image processing procedures, and allows the users to adjust a set of qualitative and descriptive parameters to achieve their subjective visualization goals. 3D image enhancement and boundary detection tools, and their integration methods with volume visualization algorithms are described. The application of this approach for 3D microscopy data exploration and analysis is also discussed.
Little is known about the cognitive abilities which influence the comprehension of scientific and information visualizations and what properties of the visualization affect comprehension. Our goal in this paper is to understand what makes visualizations difficult. We address this goal by examining the spatial ability differences in a diverse population selected for spatial ability variance. For example, how is, spatial ability related to visualization comprehension? What makes a particular visualization difficult or time intensive for specific groups of subjects? In this paper, we present the results of an experiment designed to answer these questions. Fifty-six subjects were tested on a basic visualization task and given standard paper tests of spatial abilities. An equal number of males and females were recruited in this study in order to increase spatial ability variance. Our results show that high spatial ability is correlated with accuracy on our three-dimensional visualization test, but not with time. High spatial ability subjects also had less difficulty with object complexity and the hidden properties of an object.
While there have been advances in visualization systems, particularly in multi-view visualizations and visual exploration, the process of building visualizations remains a major bottleneck in data exploration. We show that provenance metadata collected during the creation of pipelines can be reused to suggest similar content in related visualizations and guide semi-automated changes. We introduce the idea of query-by-example in the context of an ensemble of visualizations, and the use of analogies as first-class operations in a system to guide scalable interactions. We describe an implementation of these techniques in VisTrails, a publicly-available, open-source system.
Line integral convolution (LIC) is an effective technique for visualizing vector fields. The application of LIC to 3D flow fields has yet been limited by difficulties to efficiently display and animate the resulting 3D-images. Texture-based volume rendering allows interactive visualization and manipulation of 3D-LIC textures. In order to ensure the comprehensive and convenient exploration of flow fields, we suggest interactive functionality including transfer functions and different clipping mechanisms. Thereby, we efficiently substitute the calculation of LIC based on sparse noise textures and show the convenient visual access of interior structures. Further on, we introduce two approaches for animating static 3D-flow fields without the computational expense and the immense memory requirements for pre-computed 3D-textures and without loss of interactivity. This is achieved by using a single 3D-LIC texture and a set of time surfaces as clipping geometries. In our first approach we use the clipping geometry to pre-compute a special 3D-LIC texture that can be animated by time-dependent color tables. Our second approach uses time volumes to actually clip the 3D-LIC volume interactively during rasterization. Additionally, several examples demonstrate the value of our strategy in practice.
We present the use of mapping functions to automatically generate levels of detail with known error bounds for polygonal models. We develop a piece-wise linear mapping function for each simplification operation and use this function to measure deviation of the new surface from both the previous level of detail and from the original surface. In addition, we use the mapping function to compute appropriate texture coordinates if the original map has texture coordinates at its vertices. Our overall algorithm uses edge collapse operations. We present rigorous procedures for the generation of local planar projections as well as for the selection of a new vertex position for the edge collapse operation. As compared to earlier methods, our algorithm is able to compute tight error bounds on surface deviation and produce an entire continuum of levels of detail with mappings between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several models: a Ford Bronco consisting of over 300 parts and 70,000 triangles, a textured lion model consisting of 49 parts and 86,000 triangles, and a textured, wrinkled torus consisting of 79,000 triangles.
We propose a new approach to polygonal isosurface extraction that is based on extracting only the visible portion of the isosurface. The visibility tests are done in two phases. First, coarse visibility tests are performed in software to determine the visible cells. These tests are based on hierarchical tiles and shear-warp factorization. The second phase resolves the visible portions of the extracted triangles and is accomplished by the graphics hardware. While the latest isosurface extraction methods have effectively eliminated the search phase bottleneck, the cost of constructing and rendering the isosurface remains high. Many of today's large datasets contain very large and complex isosurfaces that can easily overwhelm even state-of-the-art graphics hardware. The proposed approach is output sensitive and is thus well suited for remote visualization applications where the extraction and rendering phases are done on a separate machines.
The techniques for reducing the size of a volume dataset by preserving both the geometrical/topological shape and the information encoded in an attached scalar field are attracting growing interest. Given the framework of incremental 3D mesh simplification based on edge collapse, we propose an approach for the integrated evaluation of the error introduced by both the modification of the domain and the approximation of the field of the original volume dataset. We present and compare various techniques to evaluate the approximation error or to produce a sound prediction. A flexible simplification tool has been implemented, which provides a different degree of accuracy and computational efficiency for the selection of the edge to be collapsed. Techniques for preventing a geometric or topological degeneration of the mesh are also presented.
Many sophisticated techniques for the visualization of volumetric data such as medical data have been published. While existing techniques are mature from a technical point of view, managing the complexity of visual parameters is still difficult for nonexpert users. To this end, this paper presents new ideas to facilitate the specification of optical properties for direct volume rendering. We introduce an additional level of abstraction for parametric models of transfer functions. The proposed framework allows visualization experts to design high-level transfer function models which can intuitively be used by non-expert users. The results are user interfaces which provide semantic information for specialized visualization problems. The proposed method is based on principal component analysis as well as on concepts borrowed from computer animation
We introduce a new algorithm for fitting a Catmull-Clark subdivision surface to a given shape within a prescribed tolerance, based on the method of quasi-interpolation. The fitting algorithm is fast, local and scales well since it does not require the solution of linear systems. Its convergence rate is optimal for regular meshes and our experiments show that it behaves very well for irregular meshes. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our method with examples from interactive modeling, surface fitting, and scientific visualization.
Spot noise is a technique for texture synthesis, which is very useful for vector field visualization. This paper describes improvements and extensions of the basic principle of spot noise. First, better visualization of highly curved vector fields with spot noise is achieved, by adapting the shape of the spots to the local velocity field. Second, filtering of spots is proposed to eliminate undesired low frequency components from the spot noise texture. Third, methods are described to utilize graphics hardware to generate the texture, and to produce variable viewpoint animations of spot noise on surfaces. Fourth, the synthesis of spot noise on grids with highly irregular cell sizes is described.
Presents a new rendering technique for processing multiple multi-resolution textures of LOD (level-of-detail) terrain models and describes its application to interactive, animated terrain content design. The approach is based on a multi-resolution model for terrain texture which cooperates with a multi-resolution model for terrain geometry. For each texture layer, an image pyramid and a texture tree are constructed. Multiple texture layers can be associated with one terrain model and can be combined in different ways, e.g. by blending and masking. The rendering algorithm simultaneously traverses the multi-resolution geometry model and the multi-resolution texture model, and takes into account geometric and texture approximation errors. It uses multi-pass rendering and exploits multi-texturing to achieve real-time performance. Applications include interactive texture lenses, texture animation and topographic textures. These techniques offer an enormous potential for developing new visualization applications for presenting, exploring and manipulating spatio-temporal data.
In this paper, we present a topological approach for simplifying continuous functions defined on volumetric domains. We introduce two atomic operations that remove pairs of critical points of the function and design a combinatorial algorithm that simplifies the Morse-Smale complex by repeated application of these operations. The Morse-Smale complex is a topological data structure that provides a compact representation of gradient flow between critical points of a function. Critical points paired by the Morse-Smale complex identify topological features and their importance. The simplification procedure leaves important critical points untouched, and is therefore useful for extracting desirable features. We also present a visualization of the simplified topology.
Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a unique tool for non-invasive investigation of major nerve fiber tracts. Since the popular diffusion tensor (DT-MRI) model is limited to voxels with a single fiber direction, a number of high angular resolution techniques have been proposed to provide information about more diverse fiber distributions. Two such approaches are Q-Ball imaging and spherical deconvolution, which produce orientation distribution functions (ODFs) on the sphere. For analysis and visualization, the maxima of these functions have been used as principal directions, even though the results are known to be biased in case of crossing fiber tracts. In this paper, we present a more reliable technique for extracting discrete orientations from continuous ODFs, which is based on decomposing their higher-order tensor representation into an isotropic component, several rank-1 terms, and a small residual. Comparing to ground truth in synthetic data shows that the novel method reduces bias and reliably reconstructs crossing fibers which are not resolved as individual maxima in the ODF We present results on both Q-Ball and spherical deconvolution data and demonstrate that the estimated directions allow for plausible fiber tracking in a real data set.
Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, compromising the ability of these individuals to effectively perform color and visualization-related tasks. This has a significant impact on their private and professional lives. We present a physiologically-based model for simulating color vision. Our model is based on the stage theory of human color vision and is derived from data reported in electrophysiological studies. It is the first model to consistently handle normal color vision, anomalous trichromacy, and dichromacy in a unified way. We have validated the proposed model through an experimental evaluation involving groups of color vision deficient individuals and normal color vision ones. Our model can provide insights and feedback on how to improve visualization experiences for individuals with CVD. It also provides a framework for testing hypotheses about some aspects of the retinal photoreceptors in color vision deficient individuals.
In this paper, we examine whether or not information theory can be one of the theoretic frameworks for visualization. We formulate concepts and measurements for qualifying visual information. We illustrate these concepts with examples that manifest the intrinsic and implicit use of information theory in many existing visualization techniques. We outline the broad correlation between visualization and the major applications of information theory, while pointing out the difference in emphasis and some technical gaps. Our study provides compelling evidence that information theory can explain a significant number of phenomena or events in visualization, while no example has been found which is fundamentally in conflict with information theory. We also notice that the emphasis of some traditional applications of information theory, such as data compression or data communication, may not always suit visualization, as the former typically focuses on the efficient throughput of a communication channel, whilst the latter focuses on the effectiveness in aiding the perceptual and cognitive process for data understanding and knowledge discovery. These findings suggest that further theoretic developments are necessary for adopting and adapting information theory for visualization.
Explores the way in which data visualization systems, in particular modular visualization environments, can be used over the World Wide Web. The conventional approach is for the publisher of the data also to be responsible for creating the visualization, and posting it as an image on the Web. This leaves the viewer in a passive role, with no opportunity to analyse the data in any way. We look at different scenarios that occur as we transfer more responsibility for the creation of the visualization to the viewer, allowing visualization to be used for analysis as well as presentation. We have implemented one particular scenario, where the publisher mounts the raw data on the Web, and the viewer accesses this data through a modular visualization environment-in this case, IRIS Explorer. The visualization system is hosted by the publisher, but its fine control is the responsibility of the viewer. The picture is returned to the viewer as VRML, for exploration via a VRML viewer such as Webspace. We have applied this to air quality data which is posted on the Web hourly: through our system, the viewer selects what data to look at (e.g. species of pollutant, location, time period) and how to look at it-at any time and from anywhere on the Web.
Presents an algorithm that accelerates the extraction of iso-surfaces from unstructured grids by avoiding the traversal of the entire set of cells in the volume. The algorithm consists of a sweep algorithm and a data decomposition scheme. The sweep algorithm incrementally locates intersected elements, and the data decomposition scheme restricts the algorithm's worst-case performance. For data sets consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements, our algorithm can reduce the cell traversal time by more than 90% over the naive iso-surface extraction algorithm, thus facilitating interactive probing of scalar fields for large-scale problems on unstructured three-dimensional grids.
Presents a method for the hierarchical representation of vector fields. Our approach is based on iterative refinement using clustering and principal component analysis. The input to our algorithm is a discrete set of points with associated vectors. The algorithm generates a top-down segmentation of the discrete field by splitting clusters of points. We measure the error of the various approximation levels by measuring the discrepancy between streamlines generated by the original discrete field and its approximations based on much smaller discrete data sets. Our method assumes no particular structure of the field, nor does it require any topological connectivity information. It is possible to generate multi-resolution representations of vector fields using this approach.
For types of data visualization where the cost of producing images is high, and the relationship between the rendering parameters and the image produced is less than obvious, a visual representation of the exploration process can make the process more efficient and effective. Image graphs represent not only the results but also the process of data visualization. Each node in an image graph consists of an image and the corresponding visualization parameters used to produce it. Each edge in a graph shows the change in rendering parameters between the two nodes it connects. Image graphs are not just static representations; users can interact with a graph to review a previous visualization session or to perform new rendering. Operations which cause changes in rendering parameters can propagate through the graph. The user can take advantage of the information in image graphs to understand how certain parameter changes affect visualization results. Users can also share image graphs to streamline the process of collaborative visualization. We have implemented a volume visualization system using the image graph interface, and the examples presented come from this application.
The authors propose three simple, but significant improvements to the OoCS (Out-of-Core Simplification) algorithm of P. Lindstrom (2000) which increase the quality of approximations and extend the applicability of the algorithm to an even larger class of compute systems. The original OoCS algorithm has memory complexity that depends on the size of the output mesh, but no dependency on the size of the input mesh. That is, it can be used to simplify meshes of arbitrarily large size, but the complexity of the output mesh is limited by the amount of memory available. Our first contribution is a version of OoCS that removes the dependency of having enough memory to hold (even) the simplified mesh. With our new algorithm, the whole process is made essentially independent of the available memory on the host computer. Our new technique uses disk instead of main memory, but it is carefully designed to avoid costly random accesses. Our two other contributions improve the quality of the approximations generated by OoCS. We propose a scheme for preserving surface boundaries which does not use connectivity information, and a scheme for constraining the position of the "representative vertex" of a grid cell to an optimal position inside the cell.
Deformable isosurfaces, implemented with level-set methods, have demonstrated a great potential in visualization for applications such as segmentation, surface processing, and surface reconstruction. Their usefulness has been limited, however, by their high computational cost and reliance on significant parameter tuning. This paper presents a solution to these challenges by describing graphics processor (GPU) based on algorithms for solving and visualizing level-set solutions at interactive rates. Our efficient GPU-based solution relies on packing the level-set isosurface data into a dynamic, sparse texture format. As the level set moves, this sparse data structure is updated via a novel GPU to CPU message passing scheme. When the level-set solver is integrated with a real-time volume renderer operating on the same packed format, a user can visualize and steer the deformable level-set surface as it evolves. In addition, the resulting isosurface can serve as a region-of-interest specifier for the volume renderer. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of this technology for interactive volume visualization and segmentation.
We present a generic method for rapid flight planning, virtual navigation and effective camera control in a volumetric environment. Directly derived from an accurate distance from boundary (DFB) field, our automatic path planning algorithm rapidly generates centered flight paths, a skeleton, in the navigable region of the virtual environment. Based on precomputed flight paths and the DFB field, our dual-mode physically based camera control model supports a smooth, safe, and sticking-free virtual navigation with six degrees of freedom. By using these techniques, combined with accelerated volume rendering, we have successfully developed a real-time virtual colonoscopy system on low-cost PCs and confirmed the high speed, high accuracy and robustness of our techniques on more than 40 patient datasets.
A common goal of multivariate visualization is to enable data inspection at discrete points, while also illustrating larger-scale continuous structures. In diffusion tensor visualization, glyphs are typically used to meet the first goal, and methods such as texture synthesis or fiber tractography can address the second. We adapt particle systems originally developed for surface modeling and anisotropic mesh generation to enhance the utility of glyph-based tensor visualizations. By carefully distributing glyphs throughout the field (either on a slice, or in the volume) into a dense packing, using potential energy profiles shaped by the local tensor value, we remove undue visual emphasis of the regular sampling grid of the data, and the underlying continuous features become more apparent. The method is demonstrated on a DT-MRI scan of a patient with a brain tumor
Visualization has proved an efficient tool in the understanding of large data sets in computational science and engineering. There is growing interest today in the development of problem solving environments which integrate both visualization and the computational process which generates the data. The GRASPARC project has looked at some of the issues involved in creating such an environment. An architecture is proposed in which tools for computation and visualization can be embedded in a framework which assists in the management of the problem solving process. This framework has an integral data management facility which allows an audit trail of the experiments to be recorded. This design therefore allows not only steering but also backtracking and more complicated problem solving strategies. A number of demonstrator case studies have been implemented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A method is presented for the visualization of 3D vector fields. The stream polygon, which is a regular, n-sided polygon, oriented normal to the local vector, can present local deformations due to rigid body rotation and both normal and shear strain. The effect of translation and scalar functions can be represented by sweeping the stream polygon along the streamline, and by appropriately varying the radius and shading the surface of the resulting streamtube. A mathematical foundation for the stream is developed, and examples with application to velocity field visualization are provided.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper introduces a novel representation, called the InfoCrystal, that can be used as a visualization tool as well as a visual query language to help users search for information. The InfoCrystal visualizes all the possible relationships among N concepts. Users can assign relevance weights to the concepts and use thresholding to select relationships of interest. The InfoCrystal allows users to specify Boolean as well as vector-space queries graphically. Arbitrarily complex queries can be created by using the InfoCrystals as building blocks and organizing them in a hierarchical structure. The InfoCrystal enables users to explore and filter information in a flexible, dynamic and interactive way.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper describes initial results of a 3D field topology analysis for automating transfer function design aiming at comprehensible volume rendering. The conventional Reeb graph-based approach to describing topological features of 3D surfaces is extended to capture the topological skeleton of a volumetric field. Based on the analysis result, which is represented in the form of a hyper Reeb graph, a procedure is proposed for designing appropriate color/opacity transfer functions. Two analytic volume datasets are used to preliminarily prove the feasibility of the present design methodology.
Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Issues discussed include experimental results, layout algorithms, nesting offsets, labeling, animation, and small multiple displays. Treemaps prove to be a potent tool for hierarchy display. The principles discussed are applicable to many information visualization situations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Multilevel representations and mesh reduction techniques have been used for accelerating the processing and the rendering of large datasets representing scalar- or vector-valued functions defined on complex 2D or 3D meshes. We present a method based on finite element approximations which combines these two approaches in a new and unique way that is conceptually simple and theoretically sound. The main idea is to consider mesh reduction as an approximation problem in appropriate finite element spaces. Starting with a very coarse triangulation of the functional domain, a hierarchy of highly non-uniform tetrahedral (or triangular in 2D) meshes is generated adaptively by local refinement. This process is driven by controlling the local error of the piecewise linear finite element approximation of the function on each mesh element. A reliable and efficient computation of the global approximation error and a multilevel preconditioned conjugate gradient solver are the key components of the implementation. In order to analyze the properties and advantages of the adaptively generated tetrahedral meshes, we implemented two volume visualization algorithms: an iso-surface extractor and a ray-caster. Both algorithms, while conceptually simple, show significant speedups over conventional methods delivering comparable rendering quality from adaptively compressed datasets.
Segmentation of structures from measured volume data, such as anatomy in medical imaging, is a challenging data-dependent task. In this paper, we present a segmentation method that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern programmable graphics hardware in order to run significantly faster than previous methods. In addition, collocating the algorithm computation with the visualization on the graphics hardware circumvents the need to transfer data across the system bus, allowing for faster visualization and interaction. This algorithm is unique in that it utilizes sophisticated graphics hardware functionality (i.e., floating point precision, render to texture, computational masking, and fragment programs) to enable fast segmentation and interactive visualization.
VolVis is a diversified, easy to use, extensible, high performance, and portable volume visualization system for scientists and engineers as well as for visualization developers and researchers. VolVis accepts as input 3D scalar volumetric data as well as 3D volume-sampled and classical geometric models. Interaction with the data is controlled by a variety of 3D input devices in an input device-independent environment. VolVis output includes navigation preview, static images, and animation sequences. A variety of volume rendering algorithms are supported ranging from fast rough approximations, to compression-domain rendering, to accurate volumetric ray tracing and radiosity, and irregular grid rendering.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Level-of-detail rendering is essential for rendering very large, detailed worlds in real-time. Unfortunately, level-of-detail computations can be expensive, creating a bottleneck at the CPU. This paper presents the CABTT algorithm, an extension to existing binary-triangle-tree-based level-of-detail algorithms. Instead of manipulating triangles, the CABTT algorithm instead operates on clusters of geometry called aggregate triangles. This reduces CPU overhead, eliminating a bottleneck common to level-of-detail algorithms. Since aggregate triangles stay fixed over several frames, they may be cached on the video card. This further reduces CPU load and fully utilizes the hardware accelerated rendering pipeline on modern video cards. These improvements result in a fourfold increase in frame rate over ROAM at high detail levels. Our implementation renders an approximation of an 8 million triangle height field at 42 frames per second with an maximum error of 1 pixel on consumer hardware.
Front-projection display environments suffer from a fundamental problem: users and other objects in the environment can easily and inadvertently block projectors, creating shadows on the displayed image. We introduce a technique that detects and corrects transient shadows in a multi-projector display. Our approach is to minimize the difference between predicted (generated) and observed (camera) images by continuous modification of the projected image values for each display device. We speculate that the general predictive monitoring framework introduced here is capable of addressing more general radiometric consistency problems. Using an automatically-derived relative position of cameras and projectors in the display environment and a straightforward color correction scheme, the system renders an expected image for each camera location. Cameras observe the displayed image, which is compared with the expected image to detect shadowed regions. These regions are transformed to the appropriate projector frames, where corresponding pixel values are increased. In display regions where more than one projector contributes to the image, shadow regions are eliminated. We demonstrate an implementation of the technique in a multiprojector system.
Surgical approaches tailored to an individual patient's anatomy and pathology have become standard in neurosurgery. Precise preoperative planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy, neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly. In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow of preoperative planning.
Current visualization systems are designed around a single user model, making it awkward for large research teams to collectively analyse large data sets. The paper shows how the popular data flow approach to visualization can be extended to allow multiple users to collaborate-each running their own visualization pipeline but with the opportunity to connect in data generated by a colleague, Thus collaborative visualizations are 'programmed' in exactly the same 'plug-and-play' style as is now customary for single-user mode. The paper describes a system architecture that can act as a basis for the collaborative extension of any data flow visualization system, and the ideas are demonstrated through a particular implementation in terms of IRIS Explorer.
Anatomy-based facial tissue modeling for surgical simulation is a field whose time has come. Real-time facial animation has been created in the last few years using models based on the anatomical structure of the human skin. Anatomy-based models are also under development in the field of medical visualization, with which facial surgery can be realistically simulated. In this article, we present an anatomy-based 3D finite element tissue model. Integrated into a computer-aided surgical planning system, this model allows the precise prediction of soft tissue changes resulting from the realignment of the underlying bone structure. The model has already been used in our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and has improved craniofacial surgical planning procedures. The model is described in detail, and surgical simulation results are shown and discussed.
We present a novel approach to visualize and explore unstructured text. The underlying technology, called TOPIC-O-GRAPHY/sup TM/, applies wavelet transforms to a custom digital signal constructed from words within a document. The resultant multiresolution wavelet energy is used to analyze the characteristics of the narrative flow in the frequency domain, such as theme changes, which is then related to the overall thematic content of the text document using statistical methods. The thematic characteristics of a document can be analyzed at varying degrees of detail, ranging from section-sized text partitions to partitions consisting of a few words. Using this technology, we are developing a visualization system prototype known as TOPIC ISLANDS to browse a document, generate fuzzy document outlines, summarize text by levels of detail and according to user interests, define meaningful subdocuments, query text content, and provide summaries of topic evolution.
Interactive exploration of animated volume data is required by many application, but the huge amount of computational time and storage space needed for rendering does not yet allow the visualization of animated volumes. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm running at interactive frame rates using 3D wavelet transforms that allows for any wavelet, motion compensation techniques and various encoding schemes of the resulting wavelet coefficients to be used. We analyze different families and orders of wavelets for compression ratio and the introduced error. We use a quantization that has been optimized for the visual impression of the reconstructed volume, independent of the viewing algorithm. This enables us to achieve very high compression ratios while still being able to reconstruct the volume with as few visual artifacts as possible. A further improvement of the compression ratio has been achieved by applying a motion compensation scheme to exploit temporal coherency. Using these schemes, we are able to decompress each volume of our animation at interactive frame rates, while visualizing these decompressed volumes on a single PC. We also present a number of improved visualization algorithms for high-quality display using OpenGL hardware running at interactive frame rates on a standard PC.
We propose the use of textured splats as the basic display primitives for an open surface fire model. The high-detail textures help to achieve a smooth boundary of the fire and gain the small-scale turbulence appearance. We utilize the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to simulate physically-based equations describing the fire evolution and its interaction with the environment (e.g., obstacles, wind and temperature). The property of fuel and non-burning objects are defined on the lattice of the computation domain. A temperature field is also incorporated to model the generation of smoke from the fire due to incomplete combustion. The linear and local characteristics of the LBM enable us to accelerate the computation with graphics hardware to reach real-time simulation speed, while the texture splat primitives enable interactive rendering frame rates.
We present a practical and general-purpose approach to large and complex visual data analysis where visualization processing, rendering and subsequent human interpretation is constrained to the subset of data deemed interesting by the user. In many scientific data analysis applications, "interesting" data can be defined by compound Boolean range queries of the form (temperature&gt;1000) AND (70&lt;pressure&lt;90). As data sizes grow larger, a central challenge is to answer such queries as efficiently as possible. Prior work in the visualization community has focused on answering range queries for scalar fields within the context of accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. In contrast, our work describes an approach that leverages state-of-the-art indexing technology from the scientific data management community called "bitmap indexing". Our implementation, which we call "DEX" (short for dextrous data explorer), uses bitmap indexing to efficiently answer multivariate, multidimensional data queries to provide input to a visualization pipeline. We present an analysis overview and benchmark results that show bitmap indexing offers significant storage and performance improvements when compared to previous approaches for accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. More importantly, since bitmap indexing supports complex multidimensional, multivariate range queries, it is more generally applicable to scientific data visualization and analysis problems. In addition to benchmark performance and analysis, we apply DEX to a typical scientific visualization problem encountered in combustion simulation data analysis.
We present an approach to visualizing correlations in 3D multifield scalar data. The core of our approach is the computation of correlation fields, which are scalar fields containing the local correlations of subsets of the multiple fields. While the visualization of the correlation fields can be done using standard 3D volume visualization techniques, their huge number makes selection and handling a challenge. We introduce the multifield-graph to give an overview of which multiple fields correlate and to show the strength of their correlation. This information guides the selection of informative correlation fields for visualization. We use our approach to visually analyze a number of real and synthetic multifield datasets
Scalar fields arise in every scientific application. Existing scalar visualization techniques require that the user infers the global scalar structure from what is frequently an insufficient display of information. We present a visualization technique which numerically detects the structure at all scales, removing from the user the responsibility of extracting information implicit in the data, and presenting the structure explicitly for analysis. We further demonstrate how scalar topology detection proves useful for correct visualization and image processing applications such as image co-registration, isocontouring, and mesh compression.
Splatting is a volume rendering algorithm that combines efficient volume projection with a sparse data representation. Only voxels that have values inside the iso-range need to be considered, and these voxels can be projected via efficient rasterization schemes. In splatting, each projected voxel is represented as a radially symmetric interpolation kernel, equivalent to a fuzzy ball. Projecting such a basis function leaves a fuzzy impression, called a footprint or splat, on the screen. Splatting traditionally classifies and shades the voxels prior to projection, and thus each voxel footprint is weighted by the assigned voxel color and opacity. Projecting these fuzzy color balls provides a uniform screen image for homogeneous object regions, but leads to a blurry appearance of object edges. The latter is clearly undesirable, especially when the view is zoomed on the object. In this work, we manipulate the rendering pipeline of splatting by performing the classification and shading process after the voxels have been projected onto the screen. In this way volume contributions outside the iso-range never affect the image. Since shading requires gradients, we not only splat the density volume, using regular splats, but we also project the gradient volume, using gradient splats. However alternative to gradient splats, we can also compute the gradients on the projection plane using central differencing. This latter scheme cuts the number of footprint rasterization by a factor of four since only the voxel densities have to be projected.
In many applications of scientific visualization, a large quantity of data is being processed and displayed in order to enable a viewer to make informed and effective decisions. Since little data is perfect, there is almost always some degree of associated uncertainty. This uncertainty is an important part of the data and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data. Uncertainty, however, should not overshadow the data values. Many methods that address the problem of visualizing data with uncertainty can distort the data and emphasize areas with uncertain values. We have developed a method for showing the uncertainty information together with data with minimal distraction. This method uses procedurally generated annotations which are deformed according to the uncertainty information. As another possible technique we propose distorting glyphs according to the uncertainty information.
The majority of virtual endoscopy techniques tries to simulate a real endoscopy. A real endoscopy does not always give the optimal information due to the physical limitations it is subject to. In this paper, we deal with the unfolding of the surface of the colon as a possible visualization technique for diagnosis and polyp detection. A new two-step technique is presented which deals with the problems of double appearance of polyps and nonuniform sampling that other colon unfolding techniques suffer from. In the first step, a distance map from a central path induces nonlinear rays for unambiguous parameterization of the surface. The second step compensates for locally varying distortions of the unfolded surface. A technique similar to magnification fields in information visualization is hereby applied. The technique produces a single view of a complete, virtually dissected colon.
We present an efficient and automatic image-recoloring technique for dichromats that highlights important visual details that would otherwise be unnoticed by these individuals. While previous techniques approach this problem by potentially changing all colors of the original image, causing their results to look unnatural to color vision deficients, our approach preserves, as much as possible, the image's original colors. Our approach is about three orders of magnitude faster than previous ones. The results of a paired-comparison evaluation carried out with fourteen color-vision deficients (CVDs) indicated the preference of our technique over the state-of-the-art automatic recoloring technique for dichromats. When considering information visualization examples, the subjects tend to prefer our results over the original images. An extension of our technique that exaggerates color contrast tends to be preferred when CVDs compared pairs of scientific visualization images. These results provide valuable information for guiding the design of visualizations for color-vision deficients.
In this paper we present a hardware-assisted rendering technique coupled with a compression scheme for the interactive visual exploration of time-varying scalar volume data. A palette-based decoding technique and an adaptive bit allocation scheme are developed to fully utilize the texturing capability of a commodity 3-D graphics card. Using a single PC equipped with a modest amount of memory, a texture capable graphics card, and an inexpensive disk array, we are able to render hundreds of time steps of regularly gridded volume data (up to 45 millions voxels each time step) at interactive rates, permitting the visual exploration of large scientific data sets in both the temporal and spatial domain.
The authors present a ray-tracing algorithm for volume rendering designed to work efficiently when the data of interest is distributed sparsely through the volume. A simple preprocessing step identifies the voxels representing features of interest. Frequently this set of voxels, arbitrarily distributed in three-dimensional space, is a small fraction of the original voxel grid. A median-cut space partitioning scheme, combined with bounding volumes to prune void spaces in the resulting search structure, is used to store the voxels of interest in a k-d tree. The k-d tree is used as a data structure. The tree is then efficiently ray-traced to render the voxel data. The k-d tree is view independent, and can be used for animation sequences involving changes in positions of the viewer or positions of lights. This search structure has been applied to render voxel data from MRI, CAT scan, and electron density distributions.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a direct volume rendering algorithm to speed up volume animation for flow visualizations. Data coherency between consecutive simulation time steps is used to avoid casting rays from those pixels retaining color values assigned to the previous image. The algorithm calculates the differential information among a sequence of 3D volumetric simulation data. At each time step the differential information is used to compute the locations of pixels that need updating and a ray-casting method as utilized to produce the updated image. We illustrate the utility and speed of the differential volume rendering algorithm with simulation data from computational bioelectric and fluid dynamics applications. We can achieve considerable disk-space savings and nearly real-time rendering of 3D flows using low-cost, single processor workstations for models which contain hundreds of thousands of data points.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
With the development of magnetic resonance imaging techniques for acquiring diffusion tensor data from biological tissue, visualization of tensor data has become a new research focus. The diffusion tensor describes the directional dependence of water molecules' diffusion and can be represented by a three-by-three symmetric matrix. Visualization of second-order tensor fields is difficult because the data values have many degrees of freedom. Existing visualization techniques are best at portraying the tensor's properties over a two-dimensional field, or over a small subset of locations within a three-dimensional field. A means of visualizing the global structure in measured diffusion tensor data is needed. We propose the use of direct volume rendering, with novel approaches for the tensors' coloring, lighting, and opacity assignment. Hue-balls use a two-dimensional colormap on the unit sphere to illustrate the tensor's action as a linear operator. Lit-tensors provide a lighting model for tensors which includes as special cases both lit-lines (from streamline vector visualization) and standard Phong surface lighting. Together with an opacity assignment based on a novel two-dimensional barycentric space of anisotropy, these methods are shown to produce informative renderings of measured diffusion tensor data from the human brain.
The classification of volumetric data sets as well as their rendering algorithms are typically based on the representation of the underlying grid. Grid structures based on a Cartesian lattice are the de-facto standard for regular representations of volumetric data. In this paper we introduce a more general concept of regular grids for the representation of volumetric data. We demonstrate that a specific type of regular lattice-the so-called body-centered cubic-is able to represent the same data set as a Cartesian grid to the same accuracy but with 29.3% fewer samples. This speeds up traditional volume rendering algorithms by the same ratio, which we demonstrate by adopting a splatting implementation for these new lattices. We investigate different filtering methods required for computing the normals on this lattice. The lattice representation results also in lossless compression ratios that are better than previously reported. Although other regular grid structures achieve the same sample efficiency, the body-centered cubic is particularly easy to use. The only assumption necessary is that the underlying volume is isotropic and band-limited-an assumption that is valid for most practical data sets.
We present an alternative method for viewing time-varying volumetric data. We consider such data as a four-dimensional data field, rather than considering space and time as separate entities. If we treat the data in this manner, we can apply high dimensional slicing and projection techniques to generate an image hyperplane. The user is provided with an intuitive user interface to specify arbitrary hyperplanes in 4D, which can be displayed with standard volume rendering techniques. From the volume specification, we are able to extract arbitrary hyperslices, combine slices together into a hyperprojection volume, or apply a 4D raycasting method to generate the same results. In combination with appropriate integration operators and transfer functions, we are able to extract and present different space-time features to the user.
An important task in volume rendering is the visualization of boundaries between materials. This is typically accomplished using transfer functions that increase opacity based on a voxel's value and gradient. Lighting also plays a crucial role in illustrating surfaces. In this paper we present a multi-dimensional transfer function method for enhancing surfaces, not through the variation of opacity, but through the modification of surface shading. The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light.
We present an interactive algorithm to compute sound propagation paths for transmission, specular reflection and edge diffraction in complex scenes. Our formulation uses an adaptive frustum representation that is automatically sub-divided to accurately compute intersections with the scene primitives. We describe a simple and fast algorithm to approximate the visible surface for each frustum and generate new frusta based on specular reflection and edge diffraction. Our approach is applicable to all triangulated models and we demonstrate its performance on architectural and outdoor models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles and moving objects. In practice, our algorithm can perform geometric sound propagation in complex scenes at 4-20 frames per second on a multi-core PC.
The task of reconstructing the derivative of a discrete function is essential for its shading and rendering as well as being widely used in image processing and analysis. We survey the possible methods for normal estimation in volume rendering and divide them into two classes based on the delivered numerical accuracy. The three members of the first class determine the normal in two steps by employing both interpolation and derivative filters. Among these is a new method which has never been realized. The members of the first class are all equally accurate. The second class has only one member and employs a continuous derivative filter obtained through the analytic derivation of an interpolation filter. We use the new method to analytically compare the accuracy of the first class with that of the second. As a result of our analysis we show that even inexpensive schemes can in fact be more accurate than high order methods. We describe the theoretical computational cost of applying the schemes in a volume rendering application and provide guidelines for helping one choose a scheme for estimating derivatives. In particular we find that the new method can be very inexpensive and can compete with the normal estimations which pre-shade and pre-classify the volume (M. Levoy, 1988).
Scatterplots are well established means of visualizing discrete data values with two data variables as a collection of discrete points. We aim at generalizing the concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An example of a continuous input field is data defined on an n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are related to traditional discrete histograms and to the histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data values within cells, a dense and complete visualization of the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics visualization technique to be applied to typical data from scientific computation.
Volumetric data commonly has high depth complexity which makes it difficult to judge spatial relationships accurately. There are many different ways to enhance depth perception, such as shading, contours, and shadows. Artists and illustrators frequently employ halos for this purpose. In this technique, regions surrounding the edges of certain structures are darkened or brightened which makes it easier to judge occlusion. Based on this concept, we present a flexible method for enhancing and highlighting structures of interest using GPU-based direct volume rendering. Our approach uses an interactively defined halo transfer function to classify structures of interest based on data value, direction, and position. A feature-preserving spreading algorithm is applied to distribute seed values to neighboring locations, generating a controllably smooth field of halo intensities. These halo intensities are then mapped to colors and opacities using a halo profile function. Our method can be used to annotate features at interactive frame rates.
The Morse-Smale complex is an efficient representation of the gradient behavior of a scalar function, and critical points paired by the complex identify topological features and their importance. We present an algorithm that constructs the Morse-Smale complex in a series of sweeps through the data, identifying various components of the complex in a consistent manner. All components of the complex, both geometric and topological, are computed, providing a complete decomposition of the domain. Efficiency is maintained by representing the geometry of the complex in terms of point sets.
The use of multi-dimensional transfer functions for direct volume rendering has been shown to be an effective means of extracting materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. The most common multi-dimensional transfer function consists of a two-dimensional (2D) histogram with axes representing a subset of the feature space (e.g., value vs. value gradient magnitude), with each entry in the 2D histogram being the number of voxels at a given feature space pair. Users then assign color and opacity to the voxel distributions within the given feature space through the use of interactive widgets (e.g., box, circular, triangular selection). Unfortunately, such tools lead users through a trial-and-error approach as they assess which data values within the feature space map to a given area of interest within the volumetric space. In this work, we propose the addition of non-parametric clustering within the transfer function feature space in order to extract patterns and guide transfer function generation. We apply a non-parametric kernel density estimation to group voxels of similar features within the 2D histogram. These groups are then binned and colored based on their estimated density, and the user may interactively grow and shrink the binned regions to explore feature boundaries and extract regions of interest. We also extend this scheme to temporal volumetric data in which time steps of 2D histograms are composited into a histogram volume. A three-dimensional (3D) density estimation is then applied, and users can explore regions within the feature space across time without adjusting the transfer function at each time step. Our work enables users to effectively explore the structures found within a feature space of the volume and provide a context in which the user can understand how these structures relate to their volumetric data. We provide tools for enhanced exploration and manipulation of the transfer function, and we show that the initial transfer function generation serves as a reasonable base for volumetric rendering, reducing the trial-and-error overhead typically found in transfer function design.
The architecture of the Data Explorer, a scientific visualization system, is described. Data Explorer supports the visualization of a wide variety of data by means of a flexible set of visualization modules. A single powerful data model common to all modules allows a wide range of data types to be imported and passed between modules. There is integral support for parallelism, affecting the data model and the execution model. The visualization modules are highly interoperable, due in part to the common data model, and exemplified by the renderer. An execution model facilitates parallelization of modules and incorporates optimizations such as caching. The two-process client-server system structure consists of a user interface that communicates with an executive via a dataflow language.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An algorithm is presented which describes an application independent method for reducing the number of polygonal primitives required to faithfully represent an object. Reducing polygon count without a corresponding reduction in object detail is important for: achieving interactive frame rates in scientific visualization, reducing mass storage requirements, and facilitating the transmission of large, multi-timestep geometric data sets. This paper shows how coplanar and nearly coplanar polygons can be merged into larger complex polygons and re-triangulated into fewer simple polygons than originally required. The notable contributions of this paper are: (1) a method for quickly grouping polygons into nearly coplanar sets, (2) a fast approach for merging coplanar polygon sets and, (3) a simple, robust triangulation method for polygons created by 1 and 2. The central idea of the algorithm is the notion of treating polygonal data as a collection of segments and removing redundant segments to quickly form polygon hulls which represent the merged coplanar sets.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Swept surfaces and volumes are generated by moving a geometric model through space. Swept surfaces and volumes are important in many computer-aided design applications including geometric modeling, numerical cutter path generation, and spatial path planning. In this paper we describe a numerical algorithm to generate swept surfaces and volumes using implicit modeling techniques. The algorithm is applicable to any geometric representation for which a distance function can be computed. The algorithm also treats degenerate trajectories such as self-intersection and surface singularity. We show applications of this algorithm to maintainability design and robot path planning.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
WEAVE (Workbench Environment for Analysis and Visual Exploration) is an environment for creating interactive visualization applications. WEAVE differs from previous systems in that it provides transparent linking between custom 3D visualizations and multidimensional statistical representations, and provides interactive color brushing between all visualizations. The authors demonstrate how WEAVE can be used to rapidly prototype a biomedical application, weaving together simulation data, measurement data, and 3D anatomical data concerning the propagation of excitation in the heart. These linked statistical and custom three-dimensional visualizations of the heart can allow scientists to more effectively study the correspondence of structure and behavior.
In this paper we describe a GPU-based technique for creating illustrative visualization through interactive manipulation of volumetric models. It is partly inspired by medical illustrations, where it is common to depict cuts and deformation in order to provide a better understanding of anatomical and biological structures or surgical processes, and partly motivated by the need for a real-time solution that supports the specification and visualization of such illustrative manipulation. We propose two new feature aligned techniques, namely surface alignment and segment alignment, and compare them with the axis-aligned techniques which were reported in previous work on volume manipulation. We also present a mechanism for defining features using texture volumes, and methods for computing correct normals for the deformed volume in respect to different alignments. We describe a GPU-based implementation to achieve real-time performance of the techniques and a collection of manipulation operators including peelers, retractors, pliers and dilators which are adaptations of the metaphors and tools used in surgical procedures and medical illustrations. Our approach is directly applicable in medical and biological illustration, and we demonstrate how it works as an interactive tool for focus+context visualization, as well as a generic technique for volume graphics
Splatting is a fast volume rendering algorithm which achieves its speed by projecting voxels in the form of pre-integrated interpolation kernels, or splats. Presently, two main variants of the splatting algorithm exist: (i) the original method, in which all splats are composited back-to-front, and (ii) the sheet-buffer method, in which the splats are added in cache-sheets, aligned with the volume face most parallel to the image plane, which are subsequently composited back-to-front. The former method is prone to cause bleeding artifacts from hidden objects, while the latter method reduces bleeding, but causes very visible color popping artifacts when the orientation of the compositing sheets changes suddenly as the image screen becomes more parallel to another volume face. We present a new variant of the splatting algorithm in which the compositing sheets are always parallel to the image plane, eliminating the condition for popping, while maintaining the insensitivity to color bleeding. This enables pleasing animated viewing of volumetric objects without temporal color and lighting discontinuities. The method uses a hierarchy of partial splats and employs an efficient list-based volume traversal scheme for fast splat access. It also offers more accuracy for perspective splatting as the decomposition of the individual splats facilitates a better approximation to the diverging nature of the rays that traverse the splatting kernels.
Graphics artists commonly employ physically-based simulation for the generation of effects such as smoke, explosions, and similar phenomena. The task of finding the correct parameters for a desired result, however, is difficult and time-consuming as current tools provide little to no guidance. In this paper, we present a new approach for the visual exploration of such parameter spaces. Given a three-dimensional scene description, we utilize sampling and spatio-temporal clustering techniques to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations and their temporal evolution. Our visualization system then allows the user to explore the simulation space in a goal-oriented manner. Animation sequences with a set of desired characteristics can be composed using a novel search-by-example approach and interactive direct volume rendering is employed to provide instant visual feedback.
The recent growth in the size and availability of large triangular surface models has generated interest in compact multi-resolution progressive representation and data transmission. An ongoing challenge is to design an efficient data structure that encompasses both compactness of geometric representations and visual quality of progressive representations. We introduce a topological layering based data structure and an encoding scheme to build a compact progressive representation of an arbitrary triangular mesh (a 2D simplicial complex in 3D) with attached attribute data. This compact representation is composed of multiple levels of detail that can be progressively transmitted and displayed. The global topology, which is the number of holes and connected components, can be flexibly changed among successive levels while still achieving guaranteed size of the coarsest level mesh for very complex models. The flexibility in our encoding scheme also allows topology preserving progressivity.
In this paper we address the difficult problem of parameter-finding in image segmentation. We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the "goodness" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.
Visualization of three-dimensional steady flow has to overcome a lot of problems to be effective. Among them are occlusion of distant details, lack of directional and depth hints and occlusion. We present methods which address these problems for real-time graphic representations applicable in virtual environments. We use dashtubes, i.e., animated, opacity-mapped streamlines, as a visualization icon for 3D-flow visualization. We present a texture mapping technique to keep the level of texture detail along a streamline nearly constant even when the velocity of the flow varies considerably. An algorithm is described which distributes the dashtubes evenly in space. We apply magic lenses and magic boxes as interaction techniques for investigating densely filled areas without overwhelming the observer with visual detail. Implementation details of these methods and their integration in our virtual environment conclude the paper.
Multi-resolution hierarchies of polygons and more recently of points are familiar and useful tools for achieving interactive rendering rates. We present an algorithm for tightly integrating the two into a single hierarchical data structure. The trade-off between rendering portions of a model with points or with polygons is made automatically. Our approach to this problem is to apply a bottom-up simplification process involving not only polygon simplification operations, but point replacement and point simplification operations as well. Given one or more surface meshes, our algorithm produces a hybrid hierarchy comprising both polygon and point primitives. This hierarchy may be optimized according to the relative performance characteristics of these primitive types on the intended rendering platform. We also provide a range of aggressiveness for performing point replacement operations. The most conservative approach produces a hierarchy that is better than a purely polygonal hierarchy in some places, and roughly equal in others. A less conservative approach can trade reduced complexity at the far viewing ranges for some increased complexity at the near viewing ranges. We demonstrate our approach on a number of input models, achieving primitive counts that are 1.3 to 4.7 times smaller than those of triangle-only simplification.
Interactive visualization of large digital elevation models is of continuing interest in scientific visualization, GIS, and virtual reality applications. Taking advantage of the regular structure of grid digital elevation models, efficient hierarchical multiresolution triangulation and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering algorithms have been developed for interactive terrain visualization. Despite the higher triangle count, these approaches generally outperform mesh simplification methods that produce irregular triangulated network (TIN) based LOD representations. In this project we combine the advantage of a TIN based mesh simplification preprocess with high-performance quadtree based LOD triangulation and rendering at run-time. This approach, called QuadTIN, generates an efficient quadtree triangulation hierarchy over any irregular point set that may originate from irregular terrain sampling or from reducing oversampling in high-resolution grid digital elevation models.
This paper describes a method to simulate realistic wrinkles on clothes without fine mesh and large computational overheads. Cloth has very little in-plane deformations, as most of the deformations come from buckling. This can be looked at as area conservation property of cloth. The area conservation formulation of the method modulates the user defined wrinkle pattern, based on deformation of individual triangle. The methodology facilitates use of small in-plane deformation stiffnesses and a coarse mesh for the numerical simulation, this makes cloth simulation fast and robust. Moreover, the ability to design wrinkles (even on generalized deformable models) makes this method versatile for synthetic image generation. The method inspired from cloth wrinkling problem, being geometric in nature, can be extended to other wrinkling phenomena.
We present a generalization of the geometry coder by Touma and Gotsman (1998) to polygon meshes. We let the polygon information dictate where to apply the parallelogram rule that they use to predict vertex positions. Since polygons tend to be fairly planar and fairly convex, it is beneficial to make predictions within a polygon rather than across polygons. This, for example, avoids poor predictions due to a crease angle between polygons. Up to 90 percent of the vertices can be predicted this way. Our strategy improves geometry compression by 10 to 40 percent depending on (a) how polygonal the mesh is and (b) on the quality (planarity/convexity) of the polygons.
An important goal of scientific data analysis is to understand the behavior of a system or process based on a sample of the system. In many instances it is possible to observe both input parameters and system outputs, and characterize the system as a high-dimensional function. Such data sets arise, for instance, in large numerical simulations, as energy landscapes in optimization problems, or in the analysis of image data relating to biological or medical parameters. This paper proposes an approach to analyze and visualizing such data sets. The proposed method combines topological and geometric techniques to provide interactive visualizations of discretely sampled high-dimensional scalar fields. The method relies on a segmentation of the parameter space using an approximate Morse-Smale complex on the cloud of point samples. For each crystal of the Morse-Smale complex, a regression of the system parameters with respect to the output yields a curve in the parameter space. The result is a simplified geometric representation of the Morse-Smale complex in the high dimensional input domain. Finally, the geometric representation is embedded in 2D, using dimension reduction, to provide a visualization platform. The geometric properties of the regression curves enable the visualization of additional information about each crystal such as local and global shape, width, length, and sampling densities. The method is illustrated on several synthetic examples of two dimensional functions. Two use cases, using data sets from the UCI machine learning repository, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on real data. Finally, in collaboration with domain experts the proposed method is applied to two scientific challenges. The analysis of parameters of climate simulations and their relationship to predicted global energy flux and the concentrations of chemical species in a combustion simulation and their integration with temperature.
All orientable metric surfaces are Riemann surfaces and admit global conformal parameterizations. Riemann surface structure is a fundamental structure and governs many natural physical phenomena, such as heat diffusion and electro-magnetic fields on the surface. A good parameterization is crucial for simulation and visualization. This paper provides an explicit method for finding optimal global conformal parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces. It relies on certain holomorphic differential forms and conformal mappings from differential geometry and Riemann surface theories. Algorithms are developed to modify topology, locate zero points, and determine cohomology types of differential forms. The implementation is based on a finite dimensional optimization method. The optimal parameterization is intrinsic to the geometry, preserves angular structure, and can play an important role in various applications including texture mapping, remeshing, morphing and simulation. The method is demonstrated by visualizing the Riemann surface structure of real surfaces represented as triangle meshes.
We present a comprehensive system for weather data visualization. Weather data are multivariate and contain vector fields formed by wind speed and direction. Several well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and polar systems are integrated into our system. We also develop various novel methods, including circular pixel bar charts embedded into polar systems, enhanced parallel coordinates with S-shape axis, and weighted complete graphs. Our system was used to analyze the air pollution problem in Hong Kong and some interesting patterns have been found.
Analysis of the results obtained from material simulations is important in the physical sciences. Our research was motivated by the need to investigate the properties of a simulated porous solid as it is hit by a projectile. This paper describes two techniques for the generation of distance fields containing a minimal number of topological features, and we use them to identify features of the material. We focus on distance fields defined on a volumetric domain considering the distance to a given surface embedded within the domain. Topological features of the field are characterized by its critical points. Our first method begins with a distance field that is computed using a standard approach, and simplifies this field using ideas from Morse theory. We present a procedure for identifying and extracting a feature set through analysis of the MS complex, and apply it to find the invariants in the clean distance field. Our second method proceeds by advancing a front, beginning at the surface, and locally controlling the creation of new critical points. We demonstrate the value of topologically clean distance fields for the analysis of filament structures in porous solids. Our methods produce a curved skeleton representation of the filaments that helps material scientists to perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of pores, and hence infer important material properties. Furthermore, we provide a set of criteria for finding the "difference" between two skeletal structures, and use this to examine how the structure of the porous solid changes over several timesteps in the simulation of the particle impact.
Flow volumes are the volumetric equivalent of stream lines. They provide more information about the vector field being visualized than do stream lines or ribbons. Presented is an efficient method for producing flow volumes, composed of transparently rendered tetrahedra, for use in an interactive system. The problems of rendering, subdivision, sorting, composing artifacts, and user interaction are dealt with. Efficiency comes from rendering only the volume of the smoke, and using hardware texturing and compositing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visualization users are increasingly in need of techniques for assessing quantitative uncertainty and error in the images produced. Statistical segmentation algorithms compute these quantitative results, yet volume rendering tools typically produce only qualitative imagery via transfer function-based classification. This paper presents a visualization technique that allows users to interactively explore the uncertainty, risk, and probabilistic decision of surface boundaries. Our approach makes it possible to directly visualize the combined "fuzzy" classification results from multiple segmentations by combining these data into a unified probabilistic data space. We represent this unified space, the combination of scalar volumes from numerous segmentations, using a novel graph-based dimensionality reduction scheme. The scheme both dramatically reduces the dataset size and is suitable for efficient, high quality, quantitative visualization. Lastly, we show that the statistical risk arising from overlapping segmentations is a robust measure for visualizing features and assigning optical properties.
Scientific visualization and illustration tools are designed to help people understand the structure and complexity of scientific data with images that are as informative and intuitive as possible. In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called "topological landscapes," which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an n-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.
Many real world polygonal surfaces contain topological singularities that represent a challenge for processes such as simplification, compression, smoothing, etc. We present an algorithm for removing such singularities, thus converting non manifold sets of polygons to manifold polygonal surfaces (orientable if necessary). We identify singular vertices and edges, multiply singular vertices, and cut through singular edges. In an optional stitching phase, we join surface boundary edges that were cut, or whose endpoints are sufficiently close, while guaranteeing that the surface is a manifold. We study two different stitching strategies called "edge pinching" and "edge snapping"; when snapping, special care is required to avoid re-creating singularities. The algorithm manipulates the polygon vertex indices (surface topology) and essentially ignores vertex coordinates (surface geometry). Except for the optional stitching, the algorithm has a linear complexity in the number of vertices edges and faces, and require no floating point operation.
We present a new hierarchical clustering and visualization algorithm called H-BLOB, which groups and visualizes cluster hierarchies at multiple levels-of-detail. Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-of-detail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, our method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that H-BLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization. The versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated using examples from visual data mining.
In this paper we use advanced tensor visualization techniques to study 3D diffusion tensor MRI data of a heart. We use scalar and tensor glyph visualization methods to investigate the data and apply a moving least squares (MLS) fiber tracing method to recover and visualize the helical structure and the orientation of the heart muscle fibers.
Building visualization and analysis pipelines is a large hurdle in the adoption of visualization and workflow systems by domain scientists. In this paper, we propose techniques to help users construct pipelines by consensus-automatically suggesting completions based on a database of previously created pipelines. In particular, we compute correspondences between existing pipeline subgraphs from the database, and use these to predict sets of likely pipeline additions to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in a carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and other data products more efficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggested completions. We present an implementation of our technique in a publicly-available, open-source scientific workflow system and demonstrate efficiency gains in real-world situations.
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the area of volume visualization on irregular grids, which is mainly based on tetrahedral meshes. Even moderately fine tetrahedral meshes consume several mega-bytes of storage. For archivation and transmission compression algorithms are essential. In scientific applications lossless compression schemes are of primary interest. This paper introduces a new lossless compression scheme for the connectivity of tetrahedral meshes. Our technique can handle all tetrahedral meshes in three dimensional euclidean space even with non manifold border. We present compression and decompression algorithms which consume for reasonable meshes linear time in the number of tetrahedra. The connectivity is compressed to less than 2.4 bits per tetrahedron for all measured meshes. Thus a tetrahedral mesh can almost be reduced to the vertex coordinates, which consume in a common representation about one quarter of the total storage space. We complete our work with solutions for the compression of vertex coordinates and additional attributes, which might be attached to the mesh.
This paper introduces two efficient algorithms that compute the Contour Tree of a 3D scalar field /spl Fscr/ and its augmented version with the Betti numbers of each isosurface. The Contour Tree is a fundamental data structure in scientific visualization that is used to preprocess the domain mesh to allow optimal computation of isosurfaces with minimal overhead storage. The Contour Tree can also be used to build user interfaces reporting the complete topological characterization of a scalar field. The first part of the paper presents a new scheme that augments the Contour Tree with the Betti numbers of each isocontour in linear time. We show how to extend the scheme with the Betti number computation without increasing its complexity. Thus, we improve on the time complexity from our previous approach from O(m log m) to O(n log n+m), where m is the number of tetrahedra and n is the number of vertices in the domain of /spl Fscr/. The second part of the paper introduces a new divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the Augmented Contour Tree with improved efficiency. The central part of the scheme computes the output Contour Tree by merging two intermediate Contour Trees and is independent of the interpolant. In this way we confine any knowledge regarding a specific interpolant to an oracle that computes the tree for a single cell. We have implemented this oracle for the trilinear interpolant and plan to replace it with higher order interpolants when needed. The complexity of the scheme is O(n+t log n), where t is the number of critical points of /spl Fscr/. For the first time we can compute the Contour Tree in linear time in many practical cases when t=O(n/sup 1-/spl epsi//). Lastly, we report the running times for a parallel implementation of our algorithm, showing good scalability with the number of processors.
Modern unsteady (multi-)field visualizations require an effective reduction of the data to be displayed. From a huge amount of information the most informative parts have to be extracted. Instead of the fuzzy application dependent notion of feature, a new approach based on information theoretic concepts is introduced in this paper to detect important regions. This is accomplished by extending the concept of local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to discretized (multi-)fields. Thus, informative parts of the data can be highlighted in an application-independent, purely mathematical sense. The new measure can be applied to unsteady multifields on regular grids in any application domain. The ability to detect and visualize important parts is demonstrated using diffusion, flow, and weather simulations.
3D time-varying unstructured and structured data sets are difficult to visualize and analyze because of the immense amount of data involved. These data sets contain many evolving amorphous regions, and standard visualization techniques provide no facilities to aid the scientist to follow regions of interest. In this paper, we present a basic framework for the visualization of time-varying data sets, and a new algorithm and data structure to track volume features in unstructured scalar data sets. The algorithm and data structure are general and can be used for structured, curvilinear, adaptive and hybrid grids as well. The features tracked can be any type of connected regions. Examples are shown from ongoing research.
Time-varying, multi-variate, and comparative data sets are not easily visualized due to the amount of data that is presented to the user at once. By combining several volumes together with different operators into one visualized volume, the user is able to compare values from different data sets in space over time, run, or field without having to mentally switch between different renderings of individual data sets. In this paper, we propose using a volume shader where the user is given the ability to easily select and operate on many data volumes to create comparison relationships. The user specifies an expression with set and numerical operations and her data to see relationships between data fields. Furthermore, we render the contextual information of the volume shader by converting it to a volume tree. We visualize the different levels and nodes of the volume tree so that the user can see the results of suboperations. This gives the user a deeper understanding of the final visualization, by seeing how the parts of the whole are operationally constructed
Recent research in visual saliency has established a computational measure of perceptual importance. In this paper we present a visual-saliency-based operator to enhance selected regions of a volume. We show how we use such an operator on a user-specified saliency field to compute an emphasis field. We further discuss how the emphasis field can be integrated into the visualization pipeline through its modifications of regional luminance and chrominance. Finally, we validate our work using an eye-tracking-based user study and show that our new saliency enhancement operator is more effective at eliciting viewer attention than the traditional Gaussian enhancement operator
Line integral convolution (LIC), introduced by B. Cabral and C. Leedom (1993), is a powerful technique for imaging and animating vector fields. We extend the LIC paradigm in three ways: the existing technique is limited to vector fields over a regular Cartesian grid and we extend it to vector fields over parametric surfaces, specifically those found in curvilinear grids, used in computational fluid dynamics simulations; periodic motion filters can be used to animate the flow visualization, but when the flow lies on a parametric surface, the motion appears misleading, and we explain why this problem arises and show how to adjust the LIC algorithm to handle it; we introduce a technique to visualize vector magnitude as well as vector direction, which is based on varying the frequency of the filter function and we develop a different technique based on kernel phase shifts which we have found to show substantially better results. Implementation of these algorithms utilizes texture-mapping hardware to run in real time, which allows them to be included in interactive applications.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The representation of a scene at different levels of detail is necessary to achieve real-time rendering. In aerial views, only the part of the scene that is close to the viewing point needs to be displayed with a high level of detail, while more distant parts can be displayed with a low level of detail. However, when a sequence of images is generated and displayed in real-time, the transition between different levels of detail causes noticeable temporal aliasing. In this paper, we propose a method, based on object blending, that visually softens the transition between two levels of Delaunay triangulation. We present an algorithm that establishes, in an off-line process, a correspondence between two given polygonal objects. The correspondence enables on-line blending between two representations of an object, so that one representation (level of detail) progressively evolves into the other.
Numerical particle simulations and astronomical observations create huge data sets containing uncorrelated 3D points of varying size. These data sets cannot be visualized interactively by simply rendering millions of colored points for each frame. Therefore, in many visualization applications a scalar density corresponding to the point distribution is resampled on a regular grid for direct volume rendering. However, many fine details are usually lost for voxel resolutions which still allow interactive visualization on standard workstations. Since no surface geometry is associated with our data sets, the recently introduced point-based rendering algorithms cannot be applied as well. In this paper we propose to accelerate the visualization of scattered point data by a hierarchical data structure based on a PCA clustering procedure. By traversing this structure for each frame we can trade-off rendering speed vs. image quality. Our scheme also reduces memory consumption by using quantized relative coordinates and it allows for fast sorting of semi-transparent clusters. We analyze various software and hardware implementations of our renderer and demonstrate that we can now visualize data sets with tens of millions of points interactively with sub-pixel screen space error on current PC graphics hardware employing advanced vertex shader functionality.
We study the problem of visualizing large networks and develop techniques for effectively abstracting a network and reducing the size to a level that can be clearly viewed. Our size reduction techniques are based on sampling, where only a sample instead of the full network is visualized. We propose a randomized notion of "focus" that specifies a part of the network and the degree to which it needs to be magnified. Visualizing a sample allows our method to overcome the scalability issues inherent in visualizing massive networks. We report some characteristics that frequently occur in large networks and the conditions under which they are preserved when sampling from a network. This can be useful in selecting a proper sampling scheme that yields a sample with similar characteristics as the original network. Our method is built on top of a relational database, thus it can be easily and efficiently implemented using any off-the-shelf database software. As a proof of concept, we implement our methods and report some of our experiments over the movie database and the connectivity graph of the Web.
This paper outlines a method to dynamically replace portals with textures in a cell-partitioned model. The rendering complexity is reduced to the geometry of the current cell thus increasing interactive performance. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture (smoothly) returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close to the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.
We present an algorithm for interactively extracting and rendering isosurfaces of large volume datasets in a view-dependent fashion. A recursive tetrahedral mesh refinement scheme, based on longest edge bisection, is used to hierarchically decompose the data into a multiresolution structure. This data structure allows fast extraction of arbitrary isosurfaces to within user specified view-dependent error bounds. A data layout scheme based on hierarchical space filling curves provides access to the data in a cache coherent manner that follows the data access pattern indicated by the mesh refinement.
Multiperspective images are a useful way to visualize extended, roughly planar scenes such as landscapes or city blocks. However, constructing effective multiperspective images is something of an art. We describe an interactive system for creating multiperspective images composed of serially blended cross-slits images. Beginning with a sideways-looking video of the scene as might be captured from a moving vehicle, we allow the user to interactively specify a set of cross-slits cameras, possibly with gaps between them. In each camera, one of the slits is defined to be the camera path, which is typically horizontal, and the user is left to choose the second slit, which is typically vertical. The system then generates intermediate views between these cameras using a novel interpolation scheme, thereby producing a multiperspective image with no seams. The user can also choose the picture surface in space onto which viewing rays are projected, thereby establishing a parameterization for the image. We show how the choice of this surface can be used to create interesting visual effects. We demonstrate our system by constructing multiperspective images that summarize city blocks, including corners, blocks with deep plazas and other challenging urban situations.
An important challenge in the visualization of three-dimensional volume data is the efficient processing and rendering of time-resolved sequences. Only the use of compression techniques, which allow the reconstruction of the original domain from the compressed one locally, makes it possible to evaluate these sequences in their entirety. In this paper, a new approach for the extraction and visualization of so-called time features from within time-resolved volume data is presented. Based on the asymptotic decay of multiscale representations of spatially localized time evolutions of the data, singular points can be discriminated. Also, the corresponding Lipschitz exponents, which describe the signals' local regularity, can be determined, and can be taken as a measure of the variation in time. The compression ratio and the comprehension of the underlying signal is improved if we first restore the extracted regions which contain the most important information.
Generation of a three-dimensional model from an unorganized set of points is an active area of research in computer graphics. Alpha shapes can be employed to construct a surface which most closely reflects the object described by the points. However, no /spl alpha/-shape, for any value of /spl alpha/, can properly detail discontinuous regions of a model. We introduce herein two methods of improving the results of reconstruction using /spl alpha/-shapes: density-scaling, which modulates the value of a depending on the density of points in a region; and anisotropic shaping, which modulates the form of the /spl alpha/-ball based on point normals. We give experimental results that show the successes and limitations of our method.
This paper describes tools and techniques for the exploration of gee-scientific data from the oil and gas domain in stereoscopic virtual environments. The two main sources of data in the exploration task are seismic volumes and multivariate well logs of physical properties down a bore hole. We have developed a props-based interaction device called the cubic mouse to allow more direct and intuitive interaction with a cubic seismic volume. This device effectively places the seismic cube in the user's hand. Geologists who have tried this device have been enthusiastic about the ease of use, and were adept only a few moments after picking it up. We have also developed a multi-modal, visualisation and sonification technique for the dense, multivariate well log data. The visualisation can show two well log variables mapped along the well geometry in a bivariate colour scheme, and another variable on a sliding lens. A sonification probe is attached to the lens so that other variables can be heard. The sonification is based on a Geiger-counter metaphor that is widely understood and which makes it easy to explain. The data is sonified at higher or lower resolutions depending on the speed of the lens. Sweeps can be made at slower rates and over smaller intervals to home in on peaks, boundaries or other features in the full resolution data set.
This paper introduces a new streamline placement and selection algorithm for 3D vector fields. Instead of considering the problem as a simple feature search in data space, we base our work on the observation that most streamline fields generate a lot of self-occlusion which prevents proper visualization. In order to avoid this issue, we approach the problem in a view-dependent fashion and dynamically determine a set of streamlines which contributes to data understanding without cluttering the view. Since our technique couples flow characteristic criteria and view-dependent streamline selection we are able achieve the best of both worlds: relevant flow description and intelligible, uncluttered pictures. We detail an efficient GPU implementation of our algorithm, show comprehensive visual results on multiple datasets and compare our method with existing flow depiction techniques. Our results show that our technique greatly improves the readability of streamline visualizations on different datasets without requiring user intervention.
In this paper we present World Lines as a novel interactive visualization that provides complete control over multiple heterogeneous simulation runs. In many application areas, decisions can only be made by exploring alternative scenarios. The goal of the suggested approach is to support users in this decision making process. In this setting, the data domain is extended to a set of alternative worlds where only one outcome will actually happen. World Lines integrate simulation, visualization and computational steering into a single unified system that is capable of dealing with the extended solution space. World Lines represent simulation runs as causally connected tracks that share a common time axis. This setup enables users to interfere and add new information quickly. A World Line is introduced as a visual combination of user events and their effects in order to present a possible future. To quickly find the most attractive outcome, we suggest World Lines as the governing component in a system of multiple linked views and a simulation component. World Lines employ linking and brushing to enable comparative visual analysis of multiple simulations in linked views. Analysis results can be mapped to various visual variables that World Lines provide in order to highlight the most compelling solutions. To demonstrate this technique we present a flooding scenario and show the usefulness of the integrated approach to support informed decision making.
The Temporal Branch-on-Need Tree (T-BON) extends the three dimensional branch-on-need octree for time-varying isosurface extraction. At each time step, only those portions of the tree and data necessary to construct the current isosurface are read from disk. This algorithm can thus exploit the temporal locality of the isosurface and, as a geometric technique, spatial locality between cells in order to improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gained and memory overhead saved using this technique.
While molecular visualization software has advanced over the years, today, most tools still operate on individual molecular structures with limited facility to manipulate large multicomponent complexes. We approach this problem by extending 3D image-based rendering via programmable graphics units, resulting in an order of magnitude speedup over traditional triangle-based rendering. By incorporating a biochemically sensitive level-of-detail hierarchy into our molecular representation, we communicate appropriate volume occupancy and shape while dramatically reducing the visual clutter that normally inhibits higher-level spatial comprehension. Our hierarchical, image based rendering also allows dynamically computed physical properties data (e.g. electrostatics potential) to be mapped onto the molecular surface, tying molecular structure to molecular function. Finally, we present another approach to interactive molecular exploration using volumetric and structural rendering in tandem to discover molecular properties that neither rendering mode alone could reveal. These visualization techniques are realized in a high-performance, interactive molecular exploration tool we call TexMol, short for Texture Molecular viewer.
Smoke rendering is a standard technique for flow visualization. Most approaches are based on a volumetric, particle based, or image based representation of the smoke. This paper introduces an alternative representation of smoke structures: as semi-transparent streak surfaces. In order to make streak surface integration fast enough for interactive applications, we avoid expensive adaptive retriangulations by coupling the opacity of the triangles to their shapes. This way, the surface shows a smoke-like look even in rather turbulent areas. Furthermore, we show modifications of the approach to mimic smoke nozzles, wool tufts, and time surfaces. The technique is applied to a number of test data sets.
We study the topology of symmetric, second-order tensor fields. The goal is to represent their complex structure by a simple set of carefully chosen points and lines analogous to vector field topology. We extract topological skeletons of the eigenvector fields, and we track their evolution over time. We study tensor topological transitions and correlate tensor and vector data. The basic constituents of tensor topology are the degenerate points, or points where eigenvalues are equal to each other. Degenerate points play a similar role as critical points in vector fields. We identify two kinds of elementary degenerate points, which we call wedges and trisectors. They can combine to form more familiar singularities-such as saddles, nodes, centers, or foci. However, these are generally unstable structures in tensor fields. Finally, we show a topological rule that puts a constraint on the topology of tensor fields defined across surfaces, extending to tensor fields the Poincare-Hopf theorem for vector fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Area cartograms are used for visualizing geographically distributed data by attaching measurements to regions of a map and scaling the regions such that their areas are proportional to the measured quantities. A continuous area cartogram is a cartogram that is constructed without changing the underlying map topology. We present a new algorithm for the construction of continuous area cartograms that was developed by viewing their construction as a constrained optimization problem. The algorithm uses a relaxation method that exploits hierarchical resolution, constrained dynamics, and a scheme that alternates goals of achieving correct region areas and adjusting region shapes. It is compared favorably to existing methods in its ability to preserve region shape recognition cues, while still achieving high accuracy.
Visualization algorithms have seen substantial improvements in the past several years. However, very few algorithms have been developed for directly studying data in dimensions higher than three. Most algorithms require a sampling in three-dimensions before applying any visualization algorithms. This sampling typically ignores vital features that may be present when examined in oblique cross-sections, and places an undo burden on system resources when animation through additional dimensions is desired. For time-varying data of large data sets, smooth animation is desired at interactive rates. We provide a fast Marching Cubes like algorithm for hypercubes of any dimension. To support this, we have developed a new algorithm to automatically generate the isosurface and triangulation tables for any dimension. This allows the efficient calculation of 4D isosurfaces, which can be interactively sliced to provide smooth animation or slicing through oblique hyperplanes. The former allows for smooth animation in a very compressed format. The latter provide better tools to study time-evolving features as they move downstream. We also provide examples in using this technique to show interval volumes or the sensitivity of a particular isovalue threshold.
We propose new clipping methods that are capable of using complex geometries for volume clipping. The clipping tests exploit per-fragment operations on the graphics hardware to achieve high frame rates. In combination with texture-based volume rendering, these techniques enable the user to interactively select and explore regions of the data set. We present depth-based clipping techniques that analyze the depth structure of the boundary representation of the clip geometry to decide which parts of the volume have to be clipped. In another approach, a voxelized clip object is used to identify the clipped regions.
In this paper, we propose a volume visualization system that accepts direct manipulation through a sketch-based What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) approach. Similar to the operations in painting applications for 2D images, in our system, a full set of tools have been developed to enable direct volume rendering manipulation of color, transparency, contrast, brightness, and other optical properties by brushing a few strokes on top of the rendered volume image. To be able to smartly identify the targeted features of the volume, our system matches the sparse sketching input with the clustered features both in image space and volume space. To achieve interactivity, both special algorithms to accelerate the input identification and feature matching have been developed and implemented in our system. Without resorting to tuning transfer function parameters, our proposed system accepts sparse stroke inputs and provides users with intuitive, flexible and effective interaction during volume data exploration and visualization.
Isosurfaces are ubiquitous in many fields, including visualization, graphics, and vision. They are often the main computational component of important processing pipelines (e.g., surface reconstruction), and are heavily used in practice. The classical approach to compute isosurfaces is to apply the Marching Cubes algorithm, which although robust and simple to implement, generates surfaces that require additional processing steps to improve triangle quality and mesh size. An important issue is that in some cases, the surfaces generated by Marching Cubes are irreparably damaged, and important details are lost which can not be recovered by subsequent processing. The main motivation of this work is to develop a technique capable of constructing high-quality and high-fidelity isosurfaces. We propose a new advancing front technique that is capable of creating high-quality isosurfaces from regular and irregular volumetric datasets. Our work extends the guidance field framework of Schreiner et al. to implicit surfaces, and improves it in significant ways. In particular, we describe a set of sampling conditions that guarantee that surface features will be captured by the algorithm. We also describe an efficient technique to compute a minimal guidance field, which greatly improves performance. Our experimental results show that our technique can generate high-quality meshes from complex datasets
High quality volume rendering of SPH data requires a complex order-dependent resampling of particle quantities along the view rays. In this paper we present an efficient approach to perform this task using a novel view-space discretization of the simulation domain. Our method draws upon recent work on GPU-based particle voxelization for the efficient resampling of particles into uniform grids. We propose a new technique that leverages a perspective grid to adaptively discretize the view-volume, giving rise to a continuous level-of-detail sampling structure and reducing memory requirements compared to a uniform grid. In combination with a level-of-detail representation of the particle set, the perspective grid allows effectively reducing the amount of primitives to be processed at run-time. We demonstrate the quality and performance of our method for the rendering of fluid and gas dynamics SPH simulations consisting of many millions of particles.
An information retrieval frame work that promotes graphical displays, and that will make documents in the computer visualizable to the searcher, is described. As examples of such graphical displays, two simulation results of using a Kohonen feature map to generate map displays for information retrieval are presented and discussed. The map displays are a mapping from a high-dimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. They show document relationships by various visual cues, such as dots, links, clusters, and areas, as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. Using the map displays as an interface for document retrieval systems, the user is provided with richer visual information to support browsing and searching.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A scalable, high-resolution display may be constructed by tiling many projected images over a single display surface. One fundamental challenge for such a display is to avoid visible seams due to misalignment among the projectors. Traditional methods for avoiding seams involve sophisticated mechanical devices and expensive CRT projectors, coupled with extensive human effort for fine-tuning the projectors. The paper describes an automatic alignment method that relies on an inexpensive, uncalibrated camera to measure the relative mismatches between neighboring projectors, and then correct the projected imagery to avoid seams without significant human effort.
We present a new multiphase method for efficiently simplifying polygonal surface models of arbitrary size. It operates by combining an initial out-of-core uniform clustering phase with a subsequent in-core iterative edge contraction phase. These two phases are both driven by quadric error metrics, and quadrics are used to pass information about the original surface between phases. The result is a method that produces approximations of a quality comparable to quadric-based iterative edge contraction, but at a fraction of the cost in terms of running time and memory consumption.
Molecular dynamics simulations of proteins play a growing role in various fields such as pharmaceutical, biochemical and medical research. Accordingly, the need for high quality visualization of these protein systems raises. Highly interactive visualization techniques are especially needed for the analysis of time-dependent molecular simulations. Beside various other molecular representations the surface representations are of high importance for these applications. So far, users had to accept a trade-off between rendering quality and performance - particularly when visualizing trajectories of time-dependent protein data. We present a new approach for visualizing the solvent excluded surface of proteins using a GPU ray casting technique and thus achieving interactive frame rates even for long protein trajectories where conventional methods based on precomputation are not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a semantic simplification of the raw protein data to reduce the visual complexity of the surface and thereby accelerate the rendering without impeding perception of the protein's basic shape. We also demonstrate the application of our solvent excluded surface method to visualize the spatial probability density for the protein atoms over the whole period of the trajectory in one frame, providing a qualitative analysis of the protein flexibility.
Volume ray casting is based on sampling the data along sight rays. In this technique, reconstruction is achieved by a convolution, which collects the contribution of multiple voxels to one sample point. Splatting, on the other hand, is based on projecting data points on to the screen, and reconstruction is implemented by an "inverted convolution", where the contribution of one data element is distributed to many sample points (i.e. pixels). Splatting produces images of a quality comparable to ray casting but at greater speeds. This is achieved by pre-computing the projection footprint that the interpolation kernel leaves on the image plane. However, while fast incremental schemes can be utilized for orthographic projection, the perspective projection complicates the mapping of the footprints and is therefore rather slow. In this paper, we merge the technique of splatting with the principles of ray casting to yield a ray-driven splatting approach. We imagine splats as being suspended in object space, a splat at every voxel. Rays are then spawned to traverse the space and intersect the splats. An efficient and accurate way of intersecting and addressing the splats is described. Not only is ray-driven splatting inherently insensitive to the complexity of the perspective viewing transform, it also offers acceleration methods such as early ray termination and bounding volumes, which are methods that traditional voxel-driven splatting cannot benefit from. This results in competitive or superior performance for parallel projection, and superior performance for perspective projection.
We present an algorithm which renders opaque and/or translucent polygons embedded within volumetric data. The processing occurs such that all objects are composited in the correct order, by rendering thin slabs of the translucent polygons between volume slices using slice-order volume rendering. We implemented our algorithm with OpenGL on current general-purpose graphics systems. We discuss our system implementation, speed and image quality, as well as the renderings of several mixed scenes.
Concerns the development of non-photorealistic rendering techniques for volume visualisation. In particular, we present two pen-and-ink rendering methods, a 3D method based on non-photorealistic solid textures, and a 2/sup +/D method that involves two rendering phases in the object space and the image space respectively. As both techniques utilize volume- and image-based data representations, they can be built upon a traditional volume rendering pipeline, and can be integrated with the photorealistic methods available in such a pipeline. We demonstrate that such an integration facilitates an effective mechanism for enhancing visualisation and its interpretation.
We introduce a new subdivision-surface wavelet transform for arbitrary two-manifolds with boundary that is the first to use simple lifting-style filtering operations with bicubic precision. We also describe a conversion process for re-mapping large-scale isosurfaces to have subdivision connectivity and fair parameterizations so that the new wavelet transform can be used for compression and visualization. The main idea enabling our wavelet transform is the circular symmetrization of the filters in irregular neighborhoods, which replaces the traditional separation of filters into two 1D passes. Our wavelet transform uses polygonal base meshes to represent surface topology, from which a Catmull-Clark-style subdivision hierarchy is generated. The details between these levels of resolution are quickly computed and compactly stored as wavelet coefficients. The isosurface conversion process begins with a contour triangulation computed using conventional techniques, which we subsequently simplify with a variant edge-collapse procedure, followed by an edge-removal process. This provides a coarse initial base mesh, which is subsequently refined, relaxed and attracted in phases to converge to the contour. The conversion is designed to produce smooth, untangled and minimally-skewed parameterizations which improves the subsequent compression after applying the transform. We have demonstrated our conversion and transform for an isosurface obtained from a high-resolution turbulent-mixing hydrodynamics simulation, showing the potential for compression and level-of-detail visualization.
We present a system for enhancing observation of user interactions in virtual environments. In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate-sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.
A method is presented to obtain a unique shape description of an object by using wavelet transforms. Wavelet transform is a signal analysis technique which decomposes a signal using a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. A multiresolution expression of 3D volume data was first obtained by applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms, with the shape then being approximated with a relatively small number of 3D orthogonal functions using only the significant functions. In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets. The method is applied to real volume data, i.e. facial range data and MR images of a human head, and typical results are shown.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a method for the construction of multiple levels of tetrahedral meshes approximating a trivariate function at different levels of detail. Starting with an initial, high-resolution triangulation of a three-dimensional region, we construct coarser representation levels by collapsing tetrahedra. Each triangulation defines a linear spline function, where the function values associated with the vertices are the spline coefficients. Based on predicted errors, we collapse tetrahedron in the grid that do not cause the maximum error to exceed a use-specified threshold. Bounds are stored for individual tetrahedra and are updated as the mesh is simplified. We continue the simplification process until a certain error is reached. The result is a hierarchical data description suited for the efficient visualization of large data sets at varying levels of detail.
A long-standing research problem in computer graphics is to reproduce the visual experience of walking through a large photorealistic environment interactively. On one hand, traditional geometry-based rendering systems fall short of simulating the visual realism of a complex environment. On the other hand, image-based rendering systems have to date been unable to capture and store a sampled representation of a large environment with complex lighting and visibility effects. In this paper, we present a "sea of images," a practical approach to dense sampling, storage, and reconstruction of the plenoptic function in large, complex indoor environments. We use a motorized cart to capture omnidirectional images every few inches on a eye-height plane throughout an environment. The captured images are compressed and stored in a multiresolution hierarchy suitable for real-time prefetching during an interactive walkthrough. Later, novel images are reconstructed for a simulated observer by resampling nearby captured images. Our system acquires 15,254 images over 1,050 square feet at an average image spacing of 1.5 inches. The average capture and processing time is 7 hours. We demonstrate realistic walkthroughs of real-world environments reproducing specular reflections and occlusion effects while rendering 15-25 frames per second.
Traditional volume visualization techniques may provide incomplete clinical information needed for applications in medical visualization. In the area of vascular visualization important features such as the lumen of a diseased vessel segment may not be visible. Curved planar reformation (CPR) has proven to be an acceptable practical solution. Existing CPR techniques, however, still have diagnostically relevant limitations. In this paper, we introduce two advances methods for efficient vessel visualization, based on the concept of CPR. Both methods benefit from relaxation of spatial coherence in favor of improved feature perception. We present a new technique to visualize the interior of a vessel in a single image. A vessel is resampled along a spiral around its central axis. The helical spiral depicts the vessel volume. Furthermore, a method to display an entire vascular tree without mutually occluding vessels is presented. Minimal rotations at the bifurcations avoid occlusions. For each viewing direction the entire vessel structure is visible.
Traditionally, time-varying data has been visualized using snapshots of the individual time steps or an animation of the snapshots shown in a sequential manner. For larger datasets with many time-varying features, animation can be limited in its use, as an observer can only track a limited number of features over the last few frames. Visually inspecting each snapshot is not practical either for a large number of time-steps. We propose new techniques inspired from the illustration literature to convey change over time more effectively in a time-varying dataset. Speedlines are used extensively by cartoonists to convey motion, speed, or change over different panels. Flow ribbons are another technique used by cartoonists to depict motion in a single frame. Strobe silhouettes are used to depict previous positions of an object to convey the previous positions of the object to the user. These illustration-inspired techniques can be used in conjunction with animation to convey change over time.
Most streamline generation algorithms either provide a particular density of streamlines across the domain or explicitly detect features, such as critical points, and follow customized rules to emphasize those features. However, the former generally includes many redundant streamlines, and the latter requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take a new approach to adaptive streamline placement for steady vector fields in 2D and 3D. We define a metric for local similarity among streamlines and use this metric to grow streamlines from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces streamlines that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a streamline representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the streamline representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.
Despite the ever-growing improvements on graphics processing units and computational power, classifying 3D volume data remains a challenge.In this paper, we present a new method for classifying volume data based on the ambient occlusion of voxels. This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow.
Internet connectivity is defined by a set of routing protocols which let the routers that comprise the Internet backbone choose the best route for a packet to reach its destination. One way to improve the security and performance of Internet is to routinely examine the routing data. In this case study, we show how interactive visualization of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data helps characterize routing behavior, identify weaknesses in connectivity which could potentially cripple the Internet, as well as detect and explain actual anomalous events.
We investigate two important, common fluid flow patterns from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, namely, swirl and tumble motion typical of automotive engines. We study and visualize swirl and tumble flow using three different flow visualization techniques: direct, geometric, and texture-based. When illustrating these methods side-by-side, we describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach within a specific spatial dimension and across multiple spatial dimensions typical of an engineer's analysis. Our study is focused on steady-state flow. Based on this investigation we offer perspectives on where and when these techniques are best applied in order to visualize the behavior of swirl and tumble motion.
We present the design and evaluation of FI3D, a direct-touch data exploration technique for 3D visualization spaces. The exploration of three-dimensional data is core to many tasks and domains involving scientific visualizations. Thus, effective data navigation techniques are essential to enable comprehension, understanding, and analysis of the information space. While evidence exists that touch can provide higher-bandwidth input, somesthetic information that is valuable when interacting with virtual worlds, and awareness when working in collaboration, scientific data exploration in 3D poses unique challenges to the development of effective data manipulations. We present a technique that provides touch interaction with 3D scientific data spaces in 7 DOF. This interaction does not require the presence of dedicated objects to constrain the mapping, a design decision important for many scientific datasets such as particle simulations in astronomy or physics. We report on an evaluation that compares the technique to conventional mouse-based interaction. Our results show that touch interaction is competitive in interaction speed for translation and integrated interaction, is easy to learn and use, and is preferred for exploration and wayfinding tasks. To further explore the applicability of our basic technique for other types of scientific visualizations we present a second case study, adjusting the interaction to the illustrative visualization of fiber tracts of the brain and the manipulation of cutting planes in this context.
Many high-performance isosurface extraction algorithms have been proposed in the past several years as a result of intensive research efforts. When applying these algorithms to large-scale time-varying fields, the storage overhead incurred from storing the search index often becomes overwhelming. This paper proposes an algorithm for locating isosurface cells in time-varying fields. We devise a new data structure, called the temporal hierarchical index tree, which utilizes the temporal coherence that exists in a time-varying field and adaptively coalesces the cells' extreme values over time; the resulting extreme values are then used to create the isosurface cell search index. For a typical time-varying scalar data set, not only does this temporal hierarchical index tree require much less storage space, but also the amount of I/O required to access the indices from the disk at different time steps is substantially reduced. We illustrate the utility and speed of our algorithm with data from several large-scale time-varying CFD simulations. Our algorithm can achieve more than 80% of disk-space savings when compared with the existing techniques, while the isosurface extraction time is nearly optimal.
Multi-resolution techniques and models have been shown to be effective for the display and transmission of large static geometric object. Dynamic environments with internally deforming models and scientific simulations using dynamic meshes pose greater challenges in terms of time and space, and need the development of similar solutions. We introduce the T-DAG, an adaptive multi-resolution representation for dynamic meshes with arbitrary deformations including attribute, position, connectivity and topology changes. T-DAG stands for time-dependent directed acyclic graph which defines the structure supporting this representation. We also provide an incremental algorithm (in time) for constructing the T-DAG representation of a given input mesh. This enables the traversal and use of the multi-resolution dynamic model for partial playback while still constructing new time-steps.
We present a hardware-accelerated method for visualizing 3D flow fields. The method is based on insertion, advection, and decay of dye. To this aim, we extend the texture-based IBFV technique presented by van Wijk (2001) for 2D flow visualization in two main directions. First, we decompose the 3D flow visualization problem in a series of 2D instances of the mentioned IBFV technique. This makes our method benefit from the hardware acceleration the original IBFV technique introduced. Secondly, we extend the concept of advected gray value (or color) noise by introducing opacity (or matter) noise. This allows us to produce sparse 3D noise pattern advections, thus address the occlusion problem inherent to 3D flow visualization. Overall, the presented method delivers interactively animated 3D flow, uses only standard OpenGL 1.1 calls and 2D textures, and is simple to understand and implement.
Animation is an effective way to show how time-varying phenomena evolve over time. A key issue of generating a good animation is to select ideal views through which the user can perceive the maximum amount of information from the time-varying dataset. In this paper, we first propose an improved view selection method for static data. The method measures the quality of a static view by analyzing the opacity, color and curvature distributions of the corresponding volume rendering images from the given view. Our view selection metric prefers an even opacity distribution with a larger projection area, a larger area of salient features' colors with an even distribution among the salient features, and more perceived curvatures. We use this static view selection method and a dynamic programming approach to select time-varying views. The time-varying view selection maximizes the information perceived from the time-varying dataset based on the constraints that the time-varying view should show smooth changes of direction and near-constant speed. We also introduce a method that allows the user to generate a smooth transition between any two views in a given time step, with the perceived information maximized as well. By combining the static and dynamic view selection methods, the users are able to generate a time-varying view that shows the maximum amount of information from a time-varying data set
This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for computing the Reeb graph of a scalar function f defined on a volumetric mesh M in Ropf&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We introduce a procedure called "loop surgery" that transforms M into a mesh M' by a sequence of cuts and guarantees the Reeb graph of f(M') to be loop free. Therefore, loop surgery reduces Reeb graph computation to the simpler problem of computing a contour tree, for which well-known algorithms exist that are theoretically efficient (O(n log n)) and fast in practice. Inverse cuts reconstruct the loops removed at the beginning. The time complexity of our algorithm is that of a contour tree computation plus a loop surgery overhead, which depends on the number of handles of the mesh. Our systematic experiments confirm that for real-life data, this overhead is comparable to the computation of the contour tree, demonstrating virtually linear scalability on meshes ranging from 70 thousand to 3.5 million tetrahedra. Performance numbers show that our algorithm, although restricted to volumetric data, has an average speedup factor of 6,500 over the previous fastest techniques, handling larger and more complex data-sets. We demonstrate the verstility of our approach by extending fast topologically clean isosurface extraction to non simply-connected domains. We apply this technique in the context of pressure analysis for mechanical design. In this case, our technique produces results in matter of seconds even for the largest meshes. For the same models, previous Reeb graph techniques do not produce a result.
In this paper, we propose a new technique to visualize dense representations of time-dependent vector fields based on a Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection (LEA) scheme. The algorithm produces animations with high spatio-temporal correlation at interactive rates. With this technique, every still frame depicts the instantaneous structure of the flow, whereas an animated sequence of frames reveals the motion a dense collection of particles would take when released into the flow. The simplicity of both the resulting data structures and the implementation suggest that LEA could become a useful component of any scientific visualization toolkit concerned with the display of unsteady flows.
We present an approach for monitoring the positions of vector field singularities and related structural changes in time-dependent datasets. The concept of singularity index is discussed and extended from the well-understood planar case to the more intricate three-dimensional setting. Assuming a tetrahedral grid with linear interpolation in space and time, vector field singularities obey rules imposed by fundamental invariants (Poincare index), which we use as a basis for an efficient tracking algorithm. We apply the presented algorithm to CFD datasets to illustrate its purpose. We examine structures that exhibit topological variations with time and describe some of the insight gained with our method. Examples are given that show a correlation in the evolution of physical quantities that play a role in vortex breakdown.
We introduce the concept of streamballs for flow visualization. Streamballs are based upon implicit surface generation techniques adopted from the well-known metaballs. Their property to split or merge automatically in areas of significant divergence or convergence makes them an ideal tool for the visualization of arbitrary complex fields. Using convolution surfaces generated by continuous skeletons for streamball construction offers the possibility to visualize even tensor fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
3D time varying datasets are difficult to visualize and analyze because of the immense amount of data involved. This is especially true when the datasets are turbulent with many evolving amorphous regions, as it is difficult to observe patterns and follow regions of interest. We present our volume based feature tracking algorithm and discuss how it can be used to help visualize and analyze large time varying datasets. We also address efficiency issues in dealing with massive time varying datasets.
The interval volume is a generalization of the isosurface commonly associated with the marching cubes algorithm. Based upon samples at the locations of a 3D rectilinear grid, the algorithm produces a triangular approximation to the surface defined by F(x,y,z)=c. The interval volume is defined by /spl alpha//spl les/F(x,y,z)/spl les//spl beta/. The authors describe an algorithm for computing a tetrahedrization of a polyhedral approximation to the interval volume.
Presents a new method for using texture to visualize multi-dimensional data elements arranged on an underlying 3D height field. We hope to use simple texture patterns in combination with other visual features like hue and intensity to increase the number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in the data element are used to vary the appearance of a corresponding pexel. Texture patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by controlling three separate texture dimensions: height, density and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision and cognitive psychology have identified these dimensions as important for the formation of perceptual texture patterns. We conducted a set of controlled experiments to measure the effectiveness of these dimensions, and to identify any visual interference that may occur when all three are displayed simultaneously at the same spatial location. Results from our experiments show that these dimensions can be used in specific combinations to form perceptual textures for visualizing multidimensional datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by applying it to two real-world visualization environments: tracking typhoon activity in southeast Asia, and analyzing ocean conditions in the northern Pacific.
Grid computing provides a challenge for visualization system designers. In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner. We see dataflow at three levels: an abstract specification of the intent of the visualization; a binding of these abstract modules to a specific software system; and then a binding of software to processing and other resources. We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource. We demonstrate the work in two applications: the dispersion of a pollutant under different wind conditions; and the solution of a challenging numerical problem in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.
Line primitives are a very powerful visual attribute used for scientific visualization and in particular for 3D vector-field visualization. We extend the basic line primitives with additional visual attributes including color, line width, texture and orientation. To implement the visual attributes we represent the stylized line primitives as generalized cylinders. One important contribution of our work is an efficient rendering algorithm for stylized lines, which is hybrid in the sense that it uses both CPU and GPU based rendering. We improve the depth perception with a shadow algorithm. We present several applications for the visualization with stylized lines among which are the visualizations of 3D vector fields and molecular structures.
Typical scientific data is represented on a grid with appropriate interpolation or approximation schemes,defined on a continuous domain. The visualization of such data in parallel coordinates may reveal patterns latently contained in the data and thus can improve the understanding of multidimensional relations. In this paper, we adopt the concept of continuous scatterplots for the visualization of spatially continuous input data to derive a density model for parallel coordinates. Based on the point-line duality between scatterplots and parallel coordinates, we propose a mathematical model that maps density from a continuous scatterplot to parallel coordinates and present different algorithms for both numerical and analytical computation of the resulting density field. In addition, we show how the 2-D model can be used to successively construct continuous parallel coordinates with an arbitrary number of dimensions. Since continuous parallel coordinates interpolate data values within grid cells, a scalable and dense visualization is achieved, which will be demonstrated for typical multi-variate scientific data.
A new algorithm for identifying vortices in complex flows is presented. The scheme uses both the vorticity and pressure fields. A skeleton line along the center of a vortex is produced by a two-step predictor-corrector scheme. The technique uses the vector field to move in the direction of the skeleton line and the scalar field to correct the location in the plane perpendicular to the skeleton line. With an economical description of the vortex tube's cross-section, the skeleton compresses the representation of the flow by a factor of 4000 or more. We show how the reconstructed geometry of vortex tubes can be enhanced to help visualize helical motion.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We are investigating methods for simplifying complex models for interactive visualizations using texture based representations. The paper presents a simplification method which dynamically "caches" distant geometry into textures and trades off accurate rendering of the distant geometry for performance. Smooth transitions and continuous borders are defined between the geometry and textures thus the representations can be switched without sudden jumps (as is the case with many current texturing techniques). All the computations for the transitions can be done a priori without the need to change the textures each frame thereafter.
Presents an algorithm for the visualization of vector field topology based on Clifford algebra. It allows the detection of higher-order singularities. This is accomplished by first analysing the possible critical points and then choosing a suitable polynomial approximation, because conventional methods based on piecewise linear or bilinear approximation do not allow higher-order critical points and destroy the topology in such cases. The algorithm is still very fast, because of using linear approximation outside the areas with several critical points.
Currently, the most popular method of visualizing music is music notation. Through music notation, an experienced musician can gain an impression of how a particular piece of music sounds simply by looking at the notes on paper. However, most listeners are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the complex nature of music notation. The goal of this project is to present an alternate method for visualizing music that makes use of color and 3D space. This paper describes one method of visualizing music in 3D space. The implementation of this method shows that music visualization is an effective technique, although it is certainly not the only possible method for accomplishing the task. Throughout the course of this project, several variations and alternative approaches were discussed. The final version of this project reflects the decisions that were made in order to present the best possible representation of music data.
View-dependent simplification has emerged as a powerful tool for graphics acceleration in visualization of complex environments. However, view-dependent simplification techniques have not been able to take full advantage of the underlying graphics hardware. Specifically, triangle strips are a widely used hardware-supported mechanism to compactly represent and efficiently render static triangle meshes. However, in a view-dependent framework, the triangle mesh connectivity changes at every frame, making it difficult to use triangle strips. We present a novel data structure, Skip Strip, that efficiently maintains triangle strips during such view-dependent changes. A Skip Strip stores the vertex hierarchy nodes in a skip-list-like manner with path compression. We anticipate that Skip Strips will provide a road map to combine rendering acceleration techniques for static datasets, typical of retained-mode graphics applications, with those for dynamic datasets found in immediate-mode applications.
Tracking and visualizing local features from a time-varying volumetric data allows the user to focus on selected regions of interest, both in space and time, which can lead to a better understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to track time-varying isosurfaces and interval volumes using isosurfacing in higher dimensions. Instead of extracting the data features such as isosurfaces or interval volumes separately from multiple time steps and computing the spatial correspondence between those features, our algorithm extracts the correspondence directly from the higher dimensional geometry and thus can more efficiently follow the user selected local features in time. In addition, by analyzing the resulting higher dimensional geometry, it becomes easier to detect important topological events and the corresponding critical time steps for the selected features. With our algorithm, the user can interact with the underlying time-varying data more easily. The computation cost for performing time-varying volume tracking is also minimized.
Quantitative techniques for visualization are critical to the successful analysis of both acquired and simulated scientific data. Many visualization techniques rely on indirect mappings, such as transfer functions, to produce the final imagery. In many situations, it is preferable and more powerful to express these mappings as mathematical expressions, or queries, that can then be directly applied to the data. We present a hardware-accelerated system that provides such capabilities and exploits current graphics hardware for portions of the computational tasks that would otherwise be executed on the CPU. In our approach, the direct programming of the graphics processor using a concise data parallel language, gives scientists the capability to efficiently explore and visualize data sets.
In this paper, we present two novel texture-based techniques to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection perpendicular to the flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the density of flow representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multi-frequency noise approach.
The multi triangulation framework (MT) is a very general approach for managing adaptive resolution in triangle meshes. The key idea is arranging mesh fragments at different resolution in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which encodes the dependencies between fragments, thereby encompassing a wide class of multiresolution approaches that use hierarchies or DAGs with predefined topology. On current architectures, the classic MT is however unfit for real-time rendering, since DAG traversal costs vastly dominate raw rendering costs. In this paper, we redesign the MT framework in a GPU friendly fashion, moving its granularity from triangles to precomputed optimized triangle patches. The patches can be conveniently tri-stripped and stored in secondary memory to be loaded on demand, ready to be sent to the GPU using preferential paths. In this manner, central memory only contains the DAG structure and CPU workload becomes negligible. The major contributions of this work are: a new out-of-core multiresolution framework, that, just like the MT, encompasses a wide class of multiresolution structures; a robust and elegant way to build a well conditioned MT DAG by introducing the concept of V-partitions, that can encompass various state of the art multiresolution algorithms; an efficient multithreaded rendering engine and a general subsystem for the external memory processing and simplification of huge meshes.
We present real-time vascular visualization methods, which extend on illustrative rendering techniques to particularly accentuate spatial depth and to improve the perceptive separation of important vascular properties such as branching level and supply area. The resulting visualization can and has already been used for direct projection on a patient's organ in the operation theater where the varying absorption and reflection characteristics of the surface limit the use of color. The important contributions of our work are a GPU-based hatching algorithm for complex tubular structures that emphasizes shape and depth as well as GPU-accelerated shadow-like depth indicators, which enable reliable comparisons of depth distances in a static monoscopic 3D visualization. In addition, we verify the expressiveness of our illustration methods in a large, quantitative study with 160 subjects
A mathematical data model for scientific visualization that is based on the mathematics of fiber bundles is presented. Previous results are extended to the case of piecewise field representations (associated with grid-based data representations), and a general mathematical model for piecewise representations of fields on irregular grids is presented. The various types of regularity that can be found in computational grids and techniques for compact field representation based on each form of regularity are discussed. These techniques can be combined to obtain efficient methods for representing fields on grids with various regular or partially regular structures.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The reconstruction of isosurfaces from scalar volume data has positioned itself as a fundamental visualization technique in many different applications. But the dramatically increasing size of volumetric data sets often prohibits the handling of these models on affordable low-end single processor architectures. Distributed client-server systems integrating high-bandwidth transmission channels and Web based visualization tools are one alternative to attack this particular problem, but therefore new approaches to reduce the load of numerical processing and the number of generated primitives are required. We outline different scenarios for distributed isosurface reconstruction from large scale volumetric data sets. We demonstrate how to directly generate stripped surface representations and we introduce adaptive and hierarchical concepts to minimize the number of vertices that have to be reconstructed, transmitted and rendered. Furthermore, we propose a novel computation scheme, which allows the user to flexibly exploit locally available resources. The proposed algorithms have been merged together in order to build a platform-independent Web based application. Extensive use of VRML and Java OpenGL bindings allows for the exploration of large scale volume data quite efficiently.
The goal of this paper is to define a convolution operation which transfers image processing and pattern matching to vector fields from flow visualization. For this, a multiplication of vectors is necessary. Clifford algebra provides such a multiplication of vectors. We define a Clifford convolution on vector fields with uniform grids. The Clifford convolution works with multivector filter masks. Scalar and vector masks can be easily converted to multivector fields. So, filter masks from image processing on scalar fields can be applied as well as vector and scalar masks. Furthermore, a method for pattern matching with Clifford convolution on vector fields is described. The method is independent of the direction of the structures. This provides an automatic approach to feature detection. The features can be visualized using any known method like glyphs, isosurfaces or streamlines. The features are defined by filter masks instead of analytical properties and thus the approach is more intuitive.
Experiences during the investigation of parallel methods for faster isosurface generation on SIMD (single instruction stream, multiple data stream) machines are described. A sequential version of a well-known isosurfacing algorithm is algorithmically enhanced for a particular type of SIMD architecture. The SIMD implementation takes full advantage of the data parallel nature of the algorithm, and experiments have proven the implementation to be highly scalable. A parallel tool, which can generate 170 K polygons/s, gives scientists the means to explore large 3D scalar or vector fields interactively.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Oriented line integral convolution (OLIC) illustrates flow fields by convolving a sparse texture with an anisotropic convolution kernel. The kernel is aligned to the underlying flow of the vector field. OLIC does not only show the direction of the flow but also its orientation. The paper presents fast rendering of oriented line integral convolution (FROLIC), which is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than OLIC. Costly convolution operations as done in OLIC are replaced in FROLIC by approximating a streamlet through a set of disks with varying intensity. The issue of overlapping streamlets is discussed. Two efficient animation techniques for animating FROLIC images are described. FROLIC has been implemented as a Java applet. This allows researchers from various disciplines (typically with inhomogenous hardware environments) to conveniently explore and investigate analytically defined 2D vector fields.
A fully automatic feature detection algorithm is presented that locates and distinguishes lines of flow separation and attachment on surfaces in 3D numerical flow fields. The algorithm is based on concepts from 2D phase-plane analysis of linear vector fields. Unlike prior visualization techniques based on particle tracing or flow topology, the phase-plane algorithm detects separation using local analytic tests. The results show that it not only detects the standard closed separation lines but also the illusive open separation lines which are not captured by flow topology methods.
We present a novel approach for the direct computation of integral surfaces in time-dependent vector fields. As opposed to previous work, which we analyze in detail, our approach is based on a separation of integral surface computation into two stages: surface approximation and generation of a graphical representation. This allows us to overcome several limitations of existing techniques. We first describe an algorithm for surface integration that approximates a series of time lines using iterative refinement and computes a skeleton of the integral surface. In a second step, we generate a well-conditioned triangulation. Our approach allows a highly accurate treatment of very large time-varying vector fields in an efficient, streaming fashion. We examine the properties of the presented methods on several example datasets and perform a numerical study of its correctness and accuracy. Finally, we investigate some visualization aspects of integral surfaces.
In 1998 we introduced the idea for a project we call the Office of the Future. Our long-term vision is to provide a better every-day working environment, with high-fidelity scene reconstruction for life-sized 3D tele-collaboration. In particular, we want a true sense of presence with our remote collaborator and their real surroundings. The challenges related to this vision are enormous and involve many technical tradeoffs. This is true in particular for scene reconstruction. Researchers have been striving to achieve real-time approaches, and while they have made respectable progress, the limitations of conventional technologies relegate them to relatively low resolution in a restricted volume. We present a significant step toward our ultimate goal, via a slightly different path. In lieu of low-fidelity dynamic scene modeling we present an exceedingly high fidelity reconstruction of a real but static office. By assembling the best of available hardware and software technologies in static scene acquisition, modeling algorithms, rendering, tracking and stereo projective display, we are able to demonstrate a portal to a real office, occupied today by a mannequin, and in the future by a real remote collaborator. We now have both a compelling sense of just how good it could be, and a framework into which we will later incorporate dynamic scene modeling, as we continue to head toward our ultimate goal of 3D collaborative telepresence.
We present a simple denoising technique for geometric data represented as a semiregular mesh, based on locally adaptive Wiener filtering. The degree of denoising is controlled by a single parameter (an estimate of the relative noise level) and the time required for denoising is independent of the magnitude of the estimate. The performance of the algorithm is sufficiently fast to allow interactive local denoising.
Automatic detection of meaningful isosurfaces is important for producing informative visualizations of volume data, especially when no information about the data origin and imaging protocol is available. We propose a computationally efficient method for the automated detection of intensity transitions in volume data. In this approach, the dominant transitions correspond to clear maxima in cumulative Laplacian-weighted gray value histograms. Only one pass through the data volume is required to compute the histogram. Several other features which may be useful for exploration of data of unknown origin can be efficiently computed in a similar manner. The detected intensity transitions can be used for setting of visualization parameters for surface rendering, as well as for direct volume rendering of 3D datasets. When using surface rendering, the detected dominant intensity transition values correspond to the optimal surface isovalues for extraction of boundaries of the objects of interest. In direct volume rendering, such transitions are important for generation of the transfer functions, which are used to assign visualization properties to data voxels and determine the appearance of the rendered image. The proposed method is illustrated by examples with synthetic data as well as real biomedical datasets.
Direct volume rendering techniques map volumetric attributes (e.g., density, gradient magnitude, etc.) to visual styles. Commonly this mapping is specified by a transfer function. The specification of transfer functions is a complex task and requires expert knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. In the case of multiple volumetric attributes and multiple visual styles the specification of the multi-dimensional transfer function becomes more challenging and non-intuitive. We present a novel methodology for the specification of a mapping from several volumetric attributes to multiple illustrative visual styles. We introduce semantic layers that allow a domain expert to specify the mapping in the natural language of the domain. A semantic layer defines the mapping of volumetric attributes to one visual style. Volumetric attributes and visual styles are represented as fuzzy sets. The mapping is specified by rules that are evaluated with fuzzy logic arithmetics. The user specifies the fuzzy sets and the rules without special knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. Semantic layers allow for a linguistic specification of the mapping from attributes to visual styles replacing the traditional transfer function specification.
Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are commonly used in information visualization to provide insight into multi-variate data. These plots help to spot correlations between variables. PCPs have been successfully applied to unstructured datasets up to a few millions of points. In this paper, we present techniques to enhance the usability of PCPs for the exploration of large, multi-timepoint volumetric data sets, containing tens of millions of points per timestep. The main difficulties that arise when applying PCPs to large numbers of data points are visual clutter and slow performance, making interactive exploration infeasible. Moreover, the spatial context of the volumetric data is usually lost. We describe techniques for preprocessing using data quantization and compression, and for fast GPU-based rendering of PCPs using joint density distributions for each pair of consecutive variables, resulting in a smooth, continuous visualization. Also, fast brushing techniques are proposed for interactive data selection in multiple linked views, including a 3D spatial volume view. These techniques have been successfully applied to three large data sets: Hurricane Isabel (Vis'04 contest), the ionization front instability data set (Vis'08 design contest), and data from a large-eddy simulation of cumulus clouds. With these data, we show how PCPs can be extended to successfully visualize and interactively explore multi-timepoint volumetric datasets with an order of magnitude more data points.
Medical volumetric imaging requires high fidelity, high performance rendering algorithms. We motivate and analyze new volumetric rendering algorithms that are suited to modern parallel processing architectures. First, we describe the three major categories of volume rendering algorithms and confirm through an imaging scientist-guided evaluation that ray-casting is the most acceptable. We describe a thread- and data-parallel implementation of ray-casting that makes it amenable to key architectural trends of three modern commodity parallel architectures: multi-core, GPU, and an upcoming many-core Intel&lt;sup&gt;reg&lt;/sup&gt; architecture code-named Larrabee. We achieve more than an order of magnitude performance improvement on a number of large 3D medical datasets. We further describe a data compression scheme that significantly reduces data-transfer overhead. This allows our approach to scale well to large numbers of Larrabee cores.
In Rogowitz and Treinish (1993), we introduced an architecture for incorporating perceptual rules into the visualization process. In this architecture, higher-level descriptors of the data, metadata, flow to perceptual rules, which constrain visualization operations. In this paper, we develop a deeper analysis of the rules, the prerequisite metadata, and the system for enabling their operation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Three dimensional computer models of the anatomy generated from volume acquisitions of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful adjuncts to 2D images. This paper describes a system that merges the computer generated 3D models with live video to enhance the surgeon's understanding of the anatomy beneath the surface. The system can be used as a planning aid before the operation and provide additional information during an operation. The application of the system to a brain operation is described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is a worthy goal in scientific visualization. It allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to visually compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. We present LISTEN-a data sonification system that has been incorporated into two visualization systems: a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants; and a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. It works with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular, flexible, adaptable, portable, interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty.
This paper presents an approach to extracting and classifying higher order critical points of 3D vector fields. To do so, we place a closed convex surface s around the area of interest. Then we show that the complete 3D classification of a critical point into areas of different flow behavior is equivalent to extracting the topological skeleton of an appropriate 2D vector field on s, if each critical point is equipped with an additional bit of information. Out of this skeleton, we create an icon which replaces the complete topological structure inside s for the visualization. We apply our method to find a simplified visual representation of clusters of critical points, leading to expressive visualizations of topologically complex 3D vector fields.
Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.
The author presents a simple and flexible method of sharp coding for higher dimensional data sets that allows the database operator or the scientist quick access to promising patterns within and among records or samples. The example used is a 13-parameter set of solar wind, magnetosphere, and ground observation data collected hourly for 21 days in 1976. The software system is a prototype developed to demonstrate the glyph approach to depicting higher-dimensional data sets. The experiment was to depict all parameters simultaneously, to see if any global or local patterns emerged. This experiment proves that much more complex data can be presented for visual pattern extraction than standard methods allow.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this paper we offer several new insights and techniques for effectively using color and texture to simultaneously convey information about multiple 2D scalar and vector distributions, in a way that facilitates allowing each distribution to be understood both individually and in the context of one or more of the other distributions. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of: color weaving for simultaneously representing information about multiple co-located color encoded distributions; and texture stitching for achieving more spatially accurate multi-frequency line integral convolution representations of combined scalar and vector distributions. The target application for our research is the definition, detection and visualization of regions of interest in a turbulent boundary layer flow at moderate Reynolds number. In this work, we examine and analyze streamwise-spanwise planes of three-component velocity vectors with the goal of identifying and characterizing spatially organized packets of hairpin vortices.
Hand-crafted illustrations are often more effective than photographs for conveying the shape and important features of an object, but they require expertise and time to produce. We describe an image compositing system and user interface that allow an artist to quickly and easily create technical illustrations from a set of photographs of an object taken from the same point of view under variable lighting conditions. Our system uses a novel compositing process in which images are combined using spatially-varying light mattes, enabling the final lighting in each area of the composite to be manipulated independently. We describe an interface that provides for the painting of local lighting effects (e.g. shadows, highlights, and tangential lighting to reveal texture) directly onto the composite. We survey some of the techniques used in illustration and lighting design to convey the shape and features of objects and describe how our system can be used to apply these techniques.
We present a visual exploration paradigm that facilitates navigation through complex fiber tracts by combining traditional 3D model viewing with lower dimensional representations. To this end, we create standard streamtube models along with two two-dimensional representations, an embedding in the plane and a hierarchical clustering tree, for a given set of fiber tracts. We then link these three representations using both interaction and color obtained by embedding fiber tracts into a perceptually uniform color space. We describe an anecdotal evaluation with neuroscientists to assess the usefulness of our method in exploring anatomical and functional structures in the brain. Expert feedback indicates that, while a standalone clinical use of the proposed method would require anatomical landmarks in the lower dimensional representations, the approach would be particularly useful in accelerating tract bundle selection. Results also suggest that combining traditional 3D model viewing with lower dimensional representations can ease navigation through the complex fiber tract models, improving exploration of the connectivity in the brain.
Most multidimensional projection techniques rely on distance (dissimilarity) information between data instances to embed high-dimensional data into a visual space. When data are endowed with Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort is necessary to compute the needed distances, making multidimensional projection prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data. The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in previous methods.
An algorithm for rendering of orthographic views of volume data on data-parallel computer architectures is described. In particular, the problem or rotating the volume in regard to the communication overhead associated with finely distributed memory is analyzed. An earlier technique (shear decomposition) is extended to 3D, and it is shown how this can be mapped onto a data-parallel architecture using only grid communication during the resampling associated with the rotation. The rendering uses efficient parallel computation constructs that allow one to use sophisticated shading models and still maintain high-speed throughout. This algorithm has been implemented on the connection machine and is used in an interactive volume-rendering application, with multiple frames-per-second performance.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present an approach that integrates occlusion culling within the view-dependent rendering framework. View-dependent rendering provides the ability to change level of detail over the surface seamlessly and smoothly in real-time. The exclusive use of view-parameters to perform level-of-detail selection causes even occluded regions to be rendered in high level of detail. To overcome this serious drawback we have integrated occlusion culling into the level selection mechanism. Because computing exact visibility is expensive and it is currently not possible to perform this computation in real time, we use a visibility estimation technique instead. Our approach reduces dramatically the resolution at occluded regions.
We describe a virtual reality environment for visualizing tensor-valued volumetric datasets acquired with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). We have prototyped a virtual environment that displays geometric representations of the volumetric second-order diffusion tensor data and are developing interaction and visualization techniques for two application areas: studying changes in white-matter structures after gamma-knife capsulotomy and pre-operative planning for brain tumor surgery. Our feedback shows that compared to desktop displays, our system helps the user better interpret the large and complex geometric models, and facilitates communication among a group of users.
Most systems used for creating and displaying colormap-based visualizations are not photometrically calibrated. That is, the relationship between RGB input levels and perceived luminance is usually not known, due to variations in the monitor, hardware configuration, and the viewing environment. However, the luminance component of perceptually based colormaps should be controlled, due to the central role that luminance plays in our visual processing. We address this problem with a simple and effective method for performing luminance matching on an uncalibrated monitor. The method is akin to the minimally distinct border technique (a previous method of luminance matching used for measuring luminous efficiency), but our method relies on the brain's highly developed ability to distinguish human faces. We present a user study showing that our method produces equivalent results to the minimally distinct border technique, but with significantly improved precision. We demonstrate how results from our luminance matching method can be directly applied to create new univariate colormaps.
The current state of the art in visualization research places strong emphasis on different techniques to derive insight from disparate types of data. However, little work has investigated the visualization process itself. The information content of the visualization process - the results, history, and relationships between those results - is addressed by this work. A characterization of the visualization process is discussed, leading to a general model of the visualization exploration process. The model, based upon a new parameter derivation calculus, can be used for automated reporting, analysis, or visualized directly. An XML-based language for expressing visualization sessions using the model is also described. These sessions can then be shared and reused by collaborators. The model, along with the XML representation, provides an effective means to utilize information within the visualization process to further data exploration.
Non-linear filtering is an important task for volume analysis. This paper presents hardware-based implementations of various non-linear filters for volume smoothing with edge preservation. The Cg high-level shading language is used in combination with latest PC consumer graphics hardware. Filtering is divided into pervertex and per-fragment stages. In both stages we propose techniques to increase the filtering performance. The vertex program pre-computes texture coordinates in order to address all contributing input samples of the operator mask. Thus additional computations are avoided in the fragment program. The presented fragment programs preserve cache coherence, exploit 4D vector arithmetic, and internal fixed point arithmetic to increase performance. We show the applicability of non-linear filters as part of a GPU-based segmentation pipeline. The resulting binary mask is compressed and decompressed in the graphics memory on-the-fly.
Presents a new method to produce a hierarchical set of triangle meshes that can be used to blend different levels of detail in a smooth fashion. The algorithm produces a sequence of meshes /spl Mscr//sub 0/, /spl Mscr//sub 1/, /spl Mscr//sub 2/..., /spl Mscr//sub n/, where each mesh /spl Mscr//sub i/ can be transformed to mesh /spl Mscr//sub i+1/ through a set of triangle-collapse operations. For each triangle, a function is generated that approximates the underlying surface in the area of the triangle, and this function serves as a basis for assigning a weight to the triangle in the ordering operation, and for supplying the point to which the triangles are collapsed. This technique allows us to view a triangulated surface model at varying levels of detail while insuring that the simplified mesh approximates the original surface well.
Genus-reducing simplifications are important in constructing multiresolution hierarchies for level-of-detail-based rendering, especially for datasets that have several relatively small holes, tunnels, and cavities. We present a genus-reducing simplification approach that is complementary to the existing work on genus-preserving simplifications. We propose a simplification framework in which genus-reducing and genus-preserving simplifications alternate to yield much better multiresolution hierarchies than would have been possible by using either one of them. In our approach we first identify the holes and the concavities by extending the concept of /spl alpha/-hulls to polygonal meshes under the L/sub /spl infin// distance metric and then generate valid triangulations to fill them.
For the rendering of vector and tensor fields, several texture-based volumetric rendering methods were presented in recent years. While they have indisputable merits, the classical vertex-based rendering of integral curves has the advantage of better zooming capabilities as it is not bound to a fixed resolution. It has been shown that lighting can improve spatial perception of lines significantly, especially if lines appear in bundles. Although OpenGL does not directly support lighting of lines, fast rendering of illuminated lines can be achieved by using basic texture mapping. This existing technique is based on a maximum principle which gives a good approximation of specular reflection. Diffuse reflection however is essentially limited to bidirectional lights at infinity. We show how the realism can be further increased by improving diffuse reflection. We present simplified expressions for the Phong/Blinn lighting of infinitesimally thin cylindrical tubes. Based on these, we propose a fast rendering technique with diffuse and specular reflection for orthographic and perspective views and for multiple local and infinite lights. The method requires commonly available programmable vertex and fragment shaders and only two-dimensional lookup textures.
We present a visual analysis and exploration of fluid flow through a cooling jacket. Engineers invest a large amount of time and serious effort to optimize the flow through this engine component because of its important role in transferring heat away from the engine block. In this study we examine the design goals that engineers apply in order to construct an ideal-as-possible cooling jacket geometry and use a broad range of visualization tools in order to analyze, explore, and present the results. We systematically employ direct, geometric, and texture-based flow visualization techniques as well as automatic feature extraction and interactive feature-based methodology. And we discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of these approaches as well as the challenges, both technical and perceptual with this application. The result is a feature-rich state-of-the-art flow visualization analysis applied to an important and complex data set from real-world computational fluid dynamics simulations.
Vector field rendering is difficult in 3D because the vector icons overlap and hide each other. We propose four different techniques for visualizing vector fields only near surfaces. The first uses motion blurred particles in a thickened region around the surface. The second uses a voxel grid to contain integral curves of the vector field. The third uses many antialiased lines through the surface, and the fourth uses hairs sprouting from the surface and then bending in the direction of the vector field. All the methods use the graphics pipeline, allowing real time rotation and interaction, and the first two methods can animate the texture to move in the flow determined by the velocity field.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors describe a software system supporting interactive visualization of large terrains in a resource-limited environment, i.e. a low-end client computer accessing a large terrain database server through a low-bandwidth network. By "large", they mean that the size of the terrain database is orders of magnitude larger than the computer RAM. Superior performance is achieved by manipulating both geometric and texture data at a continuum of resolutions, and, at any given moment, using the best resolution dictated by the CPU and bandwidth constraints. The geometry is maintained as a Delaunay triangulation of a dynamic subset of the terrain data points, and the texture compressed by a progressive wavelet scheme. A careful blend of algorithmic techniques enables the system to achieve superior rendering performance on a low-end computer by optimizing the number of polygons and texture pixels sent to the graphics pipeline. It guarantees a frame rate depending only on the size and quality of the rendered image, independent of the viewing parameters and scene database size. An efficient paging scheme minimizes data I/O, thus enabling the use of the system in a low-bandwidth client/server data-streaming scenario, such as on the Internet.
Vortices are important features in many research and engineering fields. Visualization is an important step in gaining more understanding and control of vortices. Vortex detection criteria fall into two categories: point based scalar quantities, calculated at single points, and curve based geometric criteria, calculated for, e.g., streamlines. The first category is easy to compute, but does not work in all cases. The second category is more intuitive and should work in all cases, but currently only works in 2D (or 3D projected) flows. We show applications of both approaches in hydrodynamic flows.
Distance judgments are difficult in current virtual environments, limiting their effectiveness in conveying spatial information. This problem is apparent when contact occurs while a user is manipulating objects. In particular, the computer graphics used to support current-generation immersive interfaces does a poor job of providing the visual cues necessary to perceive when contact between objects is about to occur. This perception of imminent contact is important in human motor control. Its absence prevents a sense of naturalness in interactive displays which allow for object manipulation. This paper reports results from an experiment evaluating the effectiveness of binocular disparity, cast shadows and diffuse inter-reflections in signaling imminent contact in a manipulation task.
We have combined methods from volume visualization and data analysis to support better diagnosis and treatment of human retinal diseases. Many diseases can be identified by abnormalities in the thicknesses of various retinal layers captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used a support vector machine (SVM) to perform semi-automatic segmentation of retinal layers for subsequent analysis including a comparison of layer thicknesses to known healthy parameters. We have extended and generalized an older SVM approach to support better performance in a clinical setting through performance enhancements and graceful handling of inherent noise in OCT data by considering statistical characteristics at multiple levels of resolution. The addition of the multi-resolution hierarchy extends the SVM to have "global awareness". A feature, such as a retinal layer, can therefore be modeled within the SVM as a combination of statistical characteristics across all levels; thus capturing high- and low-frequency information. We have compared our semi-automatically generated segmentations to manually segmented layers for verification purposes. Our main goals were to provide a tool that could (i) be used in a clinical setting; (ii) operate on noisy OCT data; and (iii) isolate individual or multiple retinal layers in both healthy and disease cases that contain structural deformities.
The visualization and exploration of multivariate data is still a challenging task. Methods either try to visualize all variables simultaneously at each position using glyph-based approaches or use linked views for the interaction between attribute space and physical domain such as brushing of scatterplots. Most visualizations of the attribute space are either difficult to understand or suffer from visual clutter. We propose a transformation of the high-dimensional data in attribute space to 2D that results in a point cloud, called attribute cloud, such that points with similar multivariate attributes are located close to each other. The transformation is based on ideas from multivariate density estimation and manifold learning. The resulting attribute cloud is an easy to understand visualization of multivariate data in two dimensions. We explain several techniques to incorporate additional information into the attribute cloud, that help the user get a better understanding of multivariate data. Using different examples from fluid dynamics and climate simulation, we show how brushing can be used to explore the attribute cloud and find interesting structures in physical space.
We propose a probability model for the handling of complicated interactions between volumetric objects. In our model each volume is associated with a "probability map" that assigns a "surface crossing" probability to each space point according to local volume properties. The interaction between two volumes is then described by finding the intersecting regions between the volumes, and calculating the "collision probabilities" at each intersecting point from the surface crossing probabilities. To enable fast and efficient calculations, we introduce the concept of a distance map and develop two hierarchical collision detection algorithms, taking advantage of the uniform structure of volumetric datasets.
We present an interactive navigation system for virtual colonoscopy, which is based solely on high performance volume rendering. Previous colonic navigation systems have employed either a surface rendering or a Z-buffer-assisted volume rendering method that depends on the surface rendering results. Our method is a fast direct volume rendering technique that exploits distance information stored in the potential field of the camera control model, and is parallelized on a multiprocessor. Experiments have been conducted on both a simulated pipe and patients' data sets acquired with a CT scanner.
We present CEASAR, a centerline extraction algorithm that delivers smooth, accurate and robust results. Centerlines are needed for accurate measurements of length along winding tubular structures. Centerlines are also required in automatic virtual navigation through human organs, such as the colon or the aorta, as they are used to control movement and orientation of the virtual camera. We introduce a concise but general definition of a centerline, and provide an algorithm that finds the centerline accurately and rapidly. Our algorithm is provably correct for general geometries. Our solution is fully automatic, which frees the user from having to engage in data preprocessing. For a number of test datasets, we show the smooth and accurate centerlines computed by our CEASAR algorithm on a single 194 MHz MIPS R10000 CPU within five minutes.
For a comprehensive understanding of tomographic image data in medicine, interactive and high-quality direct volume rendering is an essential prerequisite. This is provided by visualization using 3D texture mapping which is still limited to high-end graphics hardware. In order to make it available in a clinical environment, we present a system which uniquely combines local desktop computers and remote high-end graphics hardware. In this context, we exploit the standard visualization capabilities to a maximum which are available in the clinical environment. For 3D representations of high resolution and quality we access the remote specialized hardware. Various tools for 2D and 3D visualization are provided which meet the requirements of a medical diagnosis. This is demonstrated with examples from the field of neuroradiology which show the value of our strategy in practice.
Volume graphics has not been accepted for widespread use. One of the inhibiting reasons is the lack of general methods for data-analysis and simple interfaces for data exploration. An error-and-trial iterative procedure is often used to select a desirable transfer function or mine the dataset for salient iso-values. New semi-automatic methods that are also data-centric have shown much promise. However, general and robust methods are still needed for data-exploration and analysis. In this paper, we propose general model-independent statistical methods based on central moments of data. Using these techniques we show how salient iso-surfaces at material boundaries can be determined. We provide examples from the medical and computational domain to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
Symmetric second-order tensor fields play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis and feature-extraction methods. The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensor's quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.
In virtual colonoscopy, CT scans are typically acquired with the patient in both supine (facing up) and prone (facing down) positions. The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.
It is shown how data visualization fits into the broader process of scientific data analysis. Scientists from several disciplines were observed while they analyzed their own data. Examination of the observations exposed process elements outside conventional image viewing. For example, analysts queried for quantitative information, made a variety of comparisons, applied math, managed data, and kept records. The characterization of scientific data analysis reveals activity beyond that traditionally supported by computer. It offers an understanding which has the potential to be applied to many future designs, and suggests specific recommendations for improving the support of this important aspect of scientific computing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Video data, generated by the entertainment industry, security and traffic cameras, video conferencing systems, video emails, and so on, is perhaps most time-consuming to process by human beings. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for "summarizing" video sequences using volume visualization techniques. We outline a system pipeline for capturing videos, extracting features, volume rendering video and feature data, and creating video visualization. We discuss a collection of image comparison metrics, including the linear dependence detector, for constructing "relative" and "absolute" difference volumes that represent the magnitude of variation between video frames. We describe the use of a few volume visualization techniques, including volume scene graphs and spatial transfer functions, for creating video visualization. In particular, we present a stream-based technique for processing and directly rendering video data in real time. With the aid of several examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using video visualization to convey meaningful information contained in video sequences.
We present a new algorithm for simplifying the shape of 3D objects by manipulating their medial axis transform (MAT). From an unorganized set of boundary points, our algorithm computes the MAT, decomposes the axis into parts, then selectively removes a subset of these parts in order to reduce the complexity of the overall shape. The result is simplified MAT that can be used for a variety of shape operations. In addition, a polygonal surface of the resulting shape can be directly generated from the filtered MAT using a robust surface reconstruction method. The algorithm presented is shown to have a number of advantages over other existing approaches.
Time and streak surfaces are ideal tools to illustrate time-varying vector fields since they directly appeal to the intuition about coherently moving particles. However, efficient generation of high-quality time and streak surfaces for complex, large and time-varying vector field data has been elusive due to the computational effort involved. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for computing such surfaces. Our approach is based on a decoupling of surface advection and surface adaptation and yields improved efficiency over other surface tracking methods, and allows us to leverage inherent parallelization opportunities in the surface advection, resulting in more rapid parallel computation. Moreover, we obtain as a result of our algorithm the entire evolution of a time or streak surface in a compact representation, allowing for interactive, high-quality rendering, visualization and exploration of the evolving surface. Finally, we discuss a number of ways to improve surface depiction through advanced rendering and texturing, while preserving interactivity, and provide a number of examples for real-world datasets and analyze the behavior of our algorithm on them.
Visualization of topological information of a vector field can provide useful information on the structure of the field. However, in turbulent flows standard critical point visualization will result in a cluttered image which is difficult to interpret. This paper presents a technique for collapsing topologies. The governing idea is to classify the importance of the critical points in the topology. By only displaying the more important critical points, a simplified depiction of the topology can be provided. Flow consistency is maintained when collapsing the topology, resulting in a visualization which is consistent with the original topology. We apply the collapsing topology technique to a turbulent flow field.
The physical interpretation of mathematical features of tensor fields is highly application-specific. Existing visualization methods for tensor fields only cover a fraction of the broad application areas. We present a visualization method tailored specifically to the class of tensor field exhibiting properties similar to stress and strain tensors, which are commonly encountered in geomechanics. Our technique is a global method that represents the physical meaning of these tensor fields with their central features: regions of compression or expansion. The method is based on two steps: first, we define a positive definite metric, with the same topological structure as the tensor field; second, we visualize the resulting metric. The eigenvector fields are represented using a texture-based approach resembling line integral convolution (LIC) methods. The eigenvalues of the metric are encoded in free parameters of the texture definition. Our method supports an intuitive distinction between positive and negative eigenvalues. We have applied our method to synthetic and some standard data sets, and "real" data from earth science and mechanical engineering application.
In nature and in flow experiments particles form patterns of swirling motion in certain locations. Existing approaches identify these structures by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them, we show how to re-formulate the problem using the parallel vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields.
This paper presents a procedure for virtual autopsies based on interactive 3D visualizations of large scale, high resolution data from CT-scans of human cadavers. The procedure is described using examples from forensic medicine and the added value and future potential of virtual autopsies is shown from a medical and forensic perspective. Based on the technical demands of the procedure state-of-the-art volume rendering techniques are applied and refined to enable real-time, full body virtual autopsies involving gigabyte sized data on standard GPUs. The techniques applied include transfer function based data reduction using level-of-detail selection and multi-resolution rendering techniques. The paper also describes a data management component for large, out-of-core data sets and an extension to the GPU-based raycaster for efficient dual TF rendering. Detailed benchmarks of the pipeline are presented using data sets from forensic cases
In order to visualize both clouds and wind in climate simulations, clouds were rendered using a 3D texture which was advected by the wind flow. The simulation is described. Rendering, the advection of texture coordinates, and haze effects are discussed. Results are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In a large number of applications, data is collected and referenced by their spatial locations. Visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data on a limited-size screen display often results in poor visualizations due to the high degree of overplotting of neighboring datapoints. We introduce a new approach to visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data. The basic idea is to intelligently use the unoccupied pixels of the display instead of overplotting data points. After formally describing the problem, we present two solutions which are based on: placing overlapping data points on the nearest unoccupied pixel; and shifting data points along a screen-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert-curve). We then develop a more sophisticated approach called Gridfit, which is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the data space. We evaluate all three approaches with respect to their efficiency and effectiveness and show the superiority of the Gridfit approach. For measuring the effectiveness, we not only present the resulting visualizations but also introduce mathematical effectiveness criteria measuring properties of the generated visualizations with respect to the original data such as distance- and position-preservation.
Surface texture is among the most salient haptic characteristics of objects; it can induce vibratory contact forces that lead to perception of roughness. We present a new algorithm to display haptic texture information resulting from the interaction between two textured objects. We compute contact forces and torques using low-resolution geometric representations along with texture images that encode surface details. We also introduce a novel force model based on directional penetration depth and describe an efficient implementation on programmable graphics hardware that enables interactive haptic texture rendering of complex models. Our force model takes into account important factors identified by psychophysics studies and is able to haptically display interaction due to fine surface textures that previous algorithms do not capture.
This paper describes an experimental study of three perceptual properties of motion: flicker, direction, and velocity. Our goal is to understand how to apply these properties to represent data in a visualization environment. Results from our experiments show that all three properties can encode multiple data values, but that minimum visual differences are needed to ensure rapid and accurate target detection: flicker must be coherent and must have a cycle length of 120 milliseconds or greater, direction must differ by at least 20/spl deg/, and velocity must differ by at least 0.43/spl deg/ of subtended visual angle. We conclude with an overview of how we are applying our results to real-world data, and then discuss future work we plan to pursue.
We introduce an approach to tracking vortex core lines in time-dependent 3D flow fields which are defined by the parallel vectors approach. They build surface structures in the 4D space-time domain. To extract them, we introduce two 4D vector fields which act as feature flow fields, i.e., their integration gives the vortex core structures. As part of this approach, we extract and classify local bifurcations of vortex core lines in space-time. Based on a 4D stream surface integration, we provide an algorithm to extract the complete vortex core structure. We apply our technique to a number of test data sets.
Characteristic curves of vector fields include stream, path, and streak lines. Stream and path lines can be obtained by a simple vector field integration of an autonomous ODE system, i.e., they can be described as tangent curves of a vector field. This facilitates their mathematical analysis including the extraction of core lines around which stream or path lines exhibit swirling motion, or the computation of their curvature for every point in the domain without actually integrating them. Such a description of streak lines is not yet available, which excludes them from most of the feature extraction and analysis tools that have been developed in our community. In this paper, we develop the first description of streak lines as tangent curves of a derived vector field - the streak line vector field - and show how it can be computed from the spatial and temporal gradients of the flow map, i.e., a dense path line integration is required. We demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach by comparing it to solutions where the ground truth is analytically known and to solutions where the ground truth has been obtained using the classic streak line computation. Furthermore, we apply a number of feature extraction and analysis tools to the new streak line vector field including the extraction of cores of swirling streak lines and the computation of streak line curvature fields. These first applications foreshadow the large variety of possible future research directions based on our new mathematical description of streak lines.
We present a method for compressing non-manifold polygonal meshes, i.e. polygonal meshes with singularities, which occur very frequently in the real-world. Most efficient polygonal compression methods currently available are restricted to a manifold mesh: they require a conversion process, and fail to retrieve the original model connectivity after decompression. The present method works by converting the original model to a manifold model, encoding the manifold model using an existing mesh compression technique, and clustering, or stitching together during the decompression process vertices that were duplicated earlier to faithfully recover the original connectivity. This paper focuses on efficiently encoding and decoding the stitching information. By separating connectivity from geometry and properties, the method avoids encoding vertices (and properties bound to vertices) multiple times; thus a reduction of the size of the bit-stream of about 10% is obtained compared with encoding the model as a manifold.
We present a new technique which enables direct volume rendering based on 3D texture mapping hardware, enabling shading as well as classification of the interpolated data. Our technique supports accurate lighting for a one directional light source, semi-transparent classification, and correct blending. To circumvent the limitations of one general classification, we introduce multiple classification spaces which are very valuable to understand the visualized data, and even mandatory to comprehensively grasp the 3D relationship of different materials present in the volumetric data. Furthermore, we illustrate how multiple classification spaces can be realized using existing graphics hardware. In contrast to previously reported algorithms, our technique is capable of performing all the above mentioned tasks within the graphics pipeline. Therefore, it is very efficient: The three dimensional texture needs to be stored only once and no load is put onto the CPU. Besides using standard OpenGL functionality, we exploit advanced per pixel operations and make use of available OpenGL extensions.
Specific rendering modes are developed for a combined visual/haptic interface to allow exploration and understanding of fluid dynamics data. The focus is on visualization of shock surfaces and vortex cores. Advantages provided by augmenting traditional graphical rendering modes with haptic rendering modes are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on synergistic combinations of visual and haptic modes which enable rapid, exploratory interaction with the data. Implementation issues are also discussed.
We derive piecewise linear and piecewise cubic box spline reconstruction filters for data sampled on the body centered cubic (BCC) lattice. We analytically derive a time domain representation of these reconstruction filters and using the Fourier slice-projection theorem we derive their frequency responses. The quality of these filters, when used in reconstructing BCC sampled volumetric data, is discussed and is demonstrated with a raycaster. Moreover, to demonstrate the superiority of the BCC sampling, the resulting reconstructions are compared with those produced from similar filters applied to data sampled on the Cartesian lattice.
Hardware-accelerated volume rendering using the GPU is now the standard approach for real-time volume rendering, although limited graphics memory can present a problem when rendering large volume data sets. Volumetric compression in which the decompression is coupled to rendering has been shown to be an effective solution to this problem; however, most existing techniques were developed in the context of software volume rendering, and all but the simplest approaches are prohibitive in a real-time hardware-accelerated volume rendering context. In this paper we present a novel block-based transform coding scheme designed specifically with real-time volume rendering in mind, such that the decompression is fast without sacrificing compression quality. This is made possible by consolidating the inverse transform with dequantization in such a way as to allow most of the reprojection to be precomputed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the freedom afforded by offline compression in order to optimize the encoding as much as possible while hiding this complexity from the decoder. In this context we develop a new block classification scheme which allows us to preserve perceptually important features in the compression. The result of this work is an asymmetric transform coding scheme that allows very large volumes to be compressed and then decompressed in real-time while rendering on the GPU.
One of the most prominent topics in climate research is the investigation, detection, and allocation of climate change. In this paper, we aim at identifying regions in the atmosphere (e.g., certain height layers) which can act as sensitive and robust indicators for climate change. We demonstrate how interactive visual data exploration of large amounts of multi-variate and time-dependent climate data enables the steered generation of promising hypotheses for subsequent statistical evaluation. The use of new visualization and interaction technology-in the context of a coordinated multiple views framework-allows not only to identify these promising hypotheses, but also to efficiently narrow down parameters that are required in the process of computational data analysis. Two datasets, namely an ECHAM5 climate model run and the ERA-40 reanalysis incorporating observational data, are investigated. Higher-order information such as linear trends or signal-to-noise ratio is derived and interactively explored in order to detect and explore those regions which react most sensitively to climate change. As one conclusion from this study, we identify an excellent potential for usefully generalizing our approach to other, similar application cases, as well.
Although direct volume rendering is established as a powerful tool for the visualization of volumetric data, efficient and reliable feature detection is still an open topic. Usually, a tradeoff between fast but imprecise classification schemes and accurate but time-consuming segmentation techniques has to be made. Furthermore, the issue of uncertainty introduced with the feature detection process is completely neglected by the majority of existing approaches.In this paper we propose a guided probabilistic volume segmentation approach that focuses on the minimization of uncertainty. In an iterative process, our system continuously assesses uncertainty of a random walker-based segmentation in order to detect regions with high ambiguity, to which the user's attention is directed to support the correction of potential misclassifications. This reduces the risk of critical segmentation errors and ensures that information about the segmentation's reliability is conveyed to the user in a dependable way. In order to improve the efficiency of the segmentation process, our technique does not only take into account the volume data to be segmented, but also enables the user to incorporate classification information. An interactive workflow has been achieved by implementing the presented system on the GPU using the OpenCL API. Our results obtained for several medical data sets of different modalities, including brain MRI and abdominal CT, demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of our approach.
The use of critical point analysis to generate representations of the vector field topology of numerical flow data sets is discussed. Critical points are located and characterized in a two-dimensional domain, which may be either a two-dimensional flow field or the tangential velocity field near a three-dimensional body. Tangent curves are then integrated out along the principal directions of certain classes of critical points. The points and curves are linked to form a skeleton representing the two-dimensional vector field topology. When generated from the tangential velocity field near a body in a three-dimensional flow, the skeleton includes the critical points and curves which provide a basis for analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the flow separation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Brushing is a data visualization technique that identifies and highlights data subsets. We introduce a form of brushing in which the brushed data is usually displayed at a different resolution than the non brushed data. The paper presents the rationale behind the multiresolution support of multivariate data visualization and describes the construction of multiresolution brushing using wavelet approximations. The idea is implemented in an enhanced version of XmdvTool. Real scientific data is used for demonstration and practical applications are suggested.
Transparency can be a useful device for simultaneously depicting multiple superimposed layers of information in a single image. However, in computer-generated pictures-as in photographs and in directly viewed actual objects-it can often be difficult to adequately perceive the three-dimensional shape of a layered transparent surface or its relative depth distance from underlying structures. Inspired by artists' use of line to show shape, we have explored methods for automatically defining a distributed set of opaque surface markings that intend to portray the three-dimensional shape and relative depth of a smoothly curving layered transparent surface in an intuitively meaningful (and minimally occluding) way. This paper describes the perceptual motivation, artistic inspiration and practical implementation of an algorithm for "texturing" a transparent surface with uniformly distributed opaque short strokes, locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature, and of length proportional to the magnitude of the surface curvature in the stroke direction. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose.
A novel approach is introduced to define a quantitative measure of closeness between vector fields. The usefulness of this measurement can be seen when comparing computational and experimental flow fields under the same conditions. Furthermore, its applicability can be extended to more cumbersome tasks, such as navigating through a large database, searching for similar topologies. This new measure relies on the use of critical points, which are a key feature in vector field topology. In order to characterize critical points, /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ parameters are introduced. They are used to form a closed set of eight unique patterns for simple critical points. These patterns are also basic building blocks for higher-order nonlinear vector fields. In order to study and compare a given set of vector fields, a measure of distance between different patterns of critical points is introduced. The basic patterns of critical points are mapped onto a unit circle in /spl alpha/-/spl beta/ space. The concept of the "Earth mover's distance" is used to compute the closeness between various pairs of vector fields, and a nearest-neighbor query is thus produced to illustrate the relationship between the given set of vector fields. This approach quantitatively measures the similarity and dissimilarity between vector fields. It is ideal for data compression of a large flow field, since only the number and types of critical points along with their corresponding /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ parameters are necessary to reconstruct the whole field. It can also be used to better quantify the changes in time-varying data sets.
Splatting is widely applied in many areas, including volume, point-based and image-based rendering. Improvements to splatting, such as eliminating popping and color bleeding, occasion-based acceleration, post-rendering classification and shading, have all been recently accomplished. These improvements share a common need for efficient frame-buffer accesses. We present an optimized software splatting package, using a newly designed primitive, called FastSplat, to scan-convert footprints. Our approach does not use texture mapping hardware, but supports the whole pipeline in memory. In such an integrated pipeline, we are then able to study the optimization strategies and address image quality issues. While this research is meant for a study of the inherent trade-off of splatting, our renderer, purely in software, achieves 3- to 5-fold speedups over a top-end texture hardware implementation (for opaque data sets). We further propose a method of efficient occlusion culling using a summed area table of opacity. 3D solid texturing and bump mapping capabilities are demonstrated to show the flexibility of such an integrated rendering pipeline. A detailed numerical error analysis, in addition to the performance and storage issues, is also presented. Our approach requires low storage and uses simple operations. Thus, it is easily implementable in hardware.
Many direct volume rendering algorithms have been proposed during the last decade to render 256/sup 3/ voxels interactively. However a lot of limitations are inherent to all of them, like low-quality images, a small viewport size or a fixed classification. In contrast, interactive high quality algorithms are still a challenge nowadays. We introduce here an efficient and accurate technique called object-order ray-casting that can achieve up to 10 fps on current workstations. Like usual ray-casting, colors and opacities are evenly sampled along the ray, but now within a new object-order algorithm. Thus, it allows to combine the main advantages of both worlds in term of speed and quality. We also describe an efficient hidden volume removal technique to compensate for the loss of early ray termination.
We propose unsteady flow advection-convolution (UFAC) as a novel visualization approach for unsteady flows. It performs time evolution governed by pathlines, but builds spatial correlation according to instantaneous streamlines whose spatial extent is controlled by the flow unsteadiness. UFAC is derived from a generic framework that provides spacetime-coherent dense representations of time dependent-vector fields by a two-step process: 1) construction of continuous trajectories in spacetime for temporal coherence; and 2) convolution along another set of paths through the above spacetime for spatially correlated patterns. Within the framework, known visualization techniques-such as Lagrangian-Eulerian advection, image-based flow visualization, unsteady flow LIC, and dynamic LIC-can be reproduced, often with better image quality, higher performance, or increased flexibility of the visualization style. Finally, we present a texture-based discretization of the framework and its interactive implementation on graphics hardware, which allows the user to gradually balance visualization speed against quality.
Accurate and reliable visualization of blood vessels is still a challenging problem, notably in the presence of morphologic changes resulting from atherosclerotic diseases. We take advantage of partially segmented data with approximately identified vessel centerlines to comprehensively visualize the diseased peripheral arterial tree. We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus &amp; context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium enhanced arteries in CT-angiography (CTA). The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. The region type, the used visualization method and the region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. This may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In this paper we furthermore present a way of how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern 3D graphics accelerators.
Transfer functions facilitate the volumetric data visualization by assigning optical properties to various data features and scalar values. Automation of transfer function specifications still remains a challenge in volume rendering. This paper presents an approach for automating transfer function generations by utilizing topological attributes derived from the contour tree of a volume. The contour tree acts as a visual index to volume segments, and captures associated topological attributes involved in volumetric data. A residue flow model based on Darcy's law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them. The proposed approach allows efficient automation of transfer function generations, and exploration on the data to be carried out based on controlling of opacity residue flow rate instead of complex low-level transfer function parameter adjustments. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the practical use of our approach in transfer function generations.
Time-dependent (unsteady) flow fields are commonly generated in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations; however, there are very few flow visualization systems that generate particle traces in unsteady flow fields. Most existing systems generate particle traces in time-independent flow fields. A particle tracing system has been developed to generate particle traces in unsteady flow fields. The system was used to visualize several 3D unsteady flow fields from real-world problems, and it has provided useful insights into the time-varying phenomena in the flow fields. The design requirements and the architecture of the system are described. Some examples of particle traces computed by the system are also shown.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The success of using a streamline technique for visualizing a vector field usually depends largely on the choice of adequate seed points. G. Turk and D. Banks (1996) developed an elegant technique for automatically placing seed points to achieve a uniform distribution of streamlines on a 2D vector field. Their method uses an energy function calculated from the low-pass filtered streamline image to guide the optimization process of the streamline distribution. This paper proposes a new technique for creating evenly distributed streamlines on 3D parametric surfaces found in curvilinear grids. We make use of Turk and Banks's 2D algorithm by first mapping the vectors on a 3D surface into the computational space of the curvilinear grid. To take into the consideration the mapping distortion caused by the uneven grid density in a curvilinear grid, a new energy function is designed and used for guiding the placement of streamlines in the computational space with desired local densities.
Presents an efficient method to automatically compute a smooth approximation of large functional scattered data sets given over arbitrarily shaped planar domains. Our approach is based on the construction of a C/sup 1/-continuous bivariate cubic spline and our method offers optimal approximation order. Both local variation and nonuniform distribution of the data are taken into account by using local polynomial least squares approximations of varying degree. Since we only need to solve small linear systems and no triangulation of the scattered data points is required, the overall complexity of the algorithm is linear in the total number of points. Numerical examples dealing with several real-world scattered data sets with up to millions of points demonstrate the efficiency of our method. The resulting spline surface is of high visual quality and can be efficiently evaluated for rendering and modeling. In our implementation we achieve real-time frame rates for typical fly-through sequences and interactive frame rates for recomputing and rendering a locally modified spline surface.
Isosurfaces are commonly used to visualize scalar fields. Critical isovalues indicate isosurface topology changes: the creation of new surface components, merging of surface components or the formation of holes in a surface component. Therefore, they highlight interesting isosurface behavior and are helpful in exploration of large trivariate data sets. We present a method that detects critical isovalues in a scalar field defined by piecewise trilinear interpolation over a rectilinear grid and describe how to use them when examining volume data. We further review varieties of the marching cubes (MC) algorithm, with the intention of preserving topology of the trilinear interpolant when extracting an isosurface. We combine and extend two approaches in such a way that it is possible to extract meaningful isosurfaces even when a critical value is chosen as the isovalue.
In this paper, we propose a quasi-static approximation (QSA) approach to simulate the movement of the movable object in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic rendering. In our QSA approach, we solve for static equilibrium during each haptic time step, ignoring any dynamical properties such as inertia. The major contribution of this approach is to overcome the computational instability problem in overly stiff systems arising from numerical integration of second-order differential equations in previous dynamic models. Our primary experimental results on both simulated aircraft geometry and a large-scale real-world aircraft engine showed that our QSA approach was capable of maintaining the 1000Hz haptic refresh rate with more robust collision avoidance and more reliable force and torque feedback.
We present a new approach for real-time sound rendering in complex, virtual scenes with dynamic sources and objects. Our approach combines the efficiency of interactive ray tracing with the accuracy of tracing a volumetric representation. We use a four-sided convex frustum and perform clipping and intersection tests using ray packet tracing. A simple and efficient formulation is used to compute secondary frusta and perform hierarchical traversal. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in an interactive system for complex environments and architectural models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles. Our algorithm can perform real-time simulation and rendering on a high-end PC.
Recent advances in scanning technology provide high resolution EM (electron microscopy) datasets that allow neuro-scientists to reconstruct complex neural connections in a nervous system. However, due to the enormous size and complexity of the resulting data, segmentation and visualization of neural processes in EM data is usually a difficult and very time-consuming task. In this paper, we present NeuroTrace, a novel EM volume segmentation and visualization system that consists of two parts: a semi-automatic multiphase level set segmentation with 3D tracking for reconstruction of neural processes, and a specialized volume rendering approach for visualization of EM volumes. It employs view-dependent on-demand filtering and evaluation of a local histogram edge metric, as well as on-the-fly interpolation and ray-casting of implicit surfaces for segmented neural structures. Both methods are implemented on the GPU for interactive performance. NeuroTrace is designed to be scalable to large datasets and data-parallel hardware architectures. A comparison of NeuroTrace with a commonly used manual EM segmentation tool shows that our interactive workflow is faster and easier to use for the reconstruction of complex neural processes.
Integral surfaces are ideal tools to illustrate vector fields and fluid flow structures. However, these surfaces can be visually complex and exhibit difficult geometric properties, owing to strong stretching, shearing and folding of the flow from which they are derived. Many techniques for non-photorealistic rendering have been presented previously. It is, however, unclear how these techniques can be applied to integral surfaces. In this paper, we examine how transparency and texturing techniques can be used with integral surfaces to convey both shape and directional information. We present a rendering pipeline that combines these techniques aimed at faithfully and accurately representing integral surfaces while improving visualization insight. The presented pipeline is implemented directly on the GPU, providing real-time interaction for all rendering modes, and does not require expensive preprocessing of integral surfaces after computation.
We present a hardware-accelerated adaptive EWA (elliptical weighted average) volume splatting algorithm. EWA splatting combines a Gaussian reconstruction kernel with a low-pass image filter for high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring. We introduce a novel adaptive filtering scheme to reduce the computational cost of EWA splatting. We show how this algorithm can be efficiently implemented on modern graphics processing units (GPUs). Our implementation includes interactive classification and fast lighting. To accelerate the rendering we store splat geometry and 3D volume data locally in GPU memory. We present results for several rectilinear volume datasets that demonstrate the high image quality and interactive rendering speed of our method.
Quality surface meshes for molecular models are desirable in the studies of protein shapes and functionalities. However, there is still no robust software that is capable to generate such meshes with good quality. In this paper, we present a Delaunay-based surface triangulation algorithm generating quality surface meshes for the molecular skin model. We expand the restricted union of balls along the surface and generate an /spl epsiv/-sampling of the skin surface incrementally. At the same time, a quality surface mesh is extracted from the Delaunay triangulation of the sample points. The algorithm supports robust and efficient implementation and guarantees the mesh quality and topology as well. Our results facilitate molecular visualization and have made a contribution towards generating quality volumetric tetrahedral meshes for the macromolecules.
Conveying shape using feature lines is an important visualization tool in visual computing. The existing feature lines (e.g., ridges, valleys, silhouettes, suggestive contours, etc.) are solely determined by local geometry properties (e.g., normals and curvatures) as well as the view position. This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present photic extremum lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surface and volume for visual computing.
Confocal microscopy is widely used in neurobiology for studying the three-dimensional structure of the nervous system. Confocal image data are often multi-channel, with each channel resulting from a different fluorescent dye or fluorescent protein; one channel may have dense data, while another has sparse; and there are often structures at several spatial scales: subneuronal domains, neurons, and large groups of neurons (brain regions). Even qualitative analysis can therefore require visualization using techniques and parameters fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Despite the plethora of volume rendering techniques that have been available for many years, the techniques standardly used in neurobiological research are somewhat rudimentary, such as looking at image slices or maximal intensity projections. Thus there is a real demand from neurobiologists, and biologists in general, for a flexible visualization tool that allows interactive visualization of multi-channel confocal data, with rapid fine-tuning of parameters to reveal the three-dimensional relationships of structures of interest. Together with neurobiologists, we have designed such a tool, choosing visualization methods to suit the characteristics of confocal data and a typical biologist's workflow. We use interactive volume rendering with intuitive settings for multidimensional transfer functions, multiple render modes and multi-views for multi-channel volume data, and embedding of polygon data into volume data for rendering and editing. As an example, we apply this tool to visualize confocal microscopy datasets of the developing zebrafish visual system.
We consider the problem of extracting discrete two-dimensional vortices from a turbulent flow. In our approach we use a reference model describing the expected physics and geometry of an idealized vortex. The model allows us to derive a novel correlation between the size of the vortex and its strength, measured as the square of its strain minus the square of its vorticity. For vortex detection in real models we use the strength parameter to locate potential vortex cores, then measure the similarity of our ideal analytical vortex and the real vortex core for different strength thresholds. This approach provides a metric for how well a vortex core is modeled by an ideal vortex. Moreover, this provides insight into the problem of choosing the thresholds that identify a vortex. By selecting a target coefficient of determination (i.e., statistical confidence), we determine on a per-vortex basis what threshold of the strength parameter would be required to extract that vortex at the chosen confidence. We validate our approach on real data from a global ocean simulation and derive from it a map of expected vortex strengths over the global ocean.
We present improved subdivision and isosurface reconstruction algorithms for polygonizing implicit surfaces and performing accurate geometric operations. Our improved reconstruction algorithm uses directed distance fields (Kobbelt et al., 2001) to detect multiple intersections along an edge, separates them into components and reconstructs an isosurface locally within each components using the dual contouring algorithm (Ju et al., 2002). It can reconstruct thin features without creating handles and results in improved surface extraction from volumetric data. Our subdivision algorithm takes into account sharp features that arise from intersecting surfaces or Boolean operations and generates an adaptive grid such that each voxel has at most one sharp feature. The subdivision algorithm is combined with our improved reconstruction algorithm to compute accurate polygonization of Boolean combinations or offsets of complex primitives that faithfully reconstruct the sharp features. We have applied these algorithms to polygonize complex CAD models designed using thousands of Boolean operations on curved primitives.
Radviz is a radial visualization with dimensions assigned to points called dimensional anchors (DAs) placed on the circumference of a circle. Records are assigned locations within the circle as a function of its relative attraction to each of the DAs. The DAs can be moved either interactively or algorithmically to reveal different meaningful patterns in the dataset. In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles. We show how features of VRV help discern patterns across the multiple cluster sets. We use the Iris data set to explain VRV and a newt gene microarray data set used in studying limb regeneration to show its utility. We then discuss further applications of VRV.
The paper presents a new approach for animating 2D steady flow fields. It is based on an original data structure called the motion map. The motion map contains not only a dense representation of the flow field but also all the motion information required to animate the flow. An important feature of this method is that it allows, in a natural way, cyclical variable-speed animations. As far as efficiency is concerned, the advantage of this method is that computing the motion map does not take more time than computing a single still image of the flow and the motion map has to be computed only once. Another advantage is that the memory requirements for a cyclical animation of an arbitrary number of frames amounts to the memory cost of a single still image.
2D and 3D views are used together in many visualization domains, such as medical imaging, flow visualization, oceanographic visualization, and computer aided design (CAD). Combining these views into one display can be done by: (1) orientation icon (i.e., separate windows), (2) in-place methods (e.g., clip and cutting planes), and (3) a new method called ExoVis. How 2D and 3D views are displayed affects ease of mental registration (understanding the spatial relationship between views), an important factor influencing user performance. This paper compares the above methods in terms of their ability to support mental registration. Empirical results show that mental registration is significantly easier with in-place displays than with ExoVis, and significantly easier with ExoVis than with orientation icons. Different mental transformation strategies can explain this result. The results suggest that ExoVis may be a better alternative to orientation icons when in-place displays are not appropriate (e.g., when in-place methods hide data or cut the 3D view into several pieces).
We are interested in 3-dimensional images given as arrays of voxels with intensity values. Extending these values to a continuous function, we study the robustness of homology classes in its level and interlevel sets, that is, the amount of perturbation needed to destroy these classes. The structure of the homology classes and their robustness, over all level and interlevel sets, can be visualized by a triangular diagram of dots obtained by computing the extended persistence of the function. We give a fast hierarchical algorithm using the dual complexes of oct-tree approximations of the function. In addition, we show that for balanced oct-trees, the dual complexes are geometrically realized in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and can thus be used to construct level and interlevel sets. We apply these tools to study 3-dimensional images of plant root systems.
The purpose of the article is the consideration of the problem of ambiguity over the faces arising in the Marching Cube algorithm. The article shows that for unambiguous choice of the sequence of the points of intersection of the isosurface with edges confining the face it is sufficient to sort them along one of the coordinates. It also presents the solution of this problem inside the cube. Graph theory methods are used to approximate the isosurface inside the cell.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
3D virtual colonoscopy has recently been proposed as a non-invasive alternative procedure for the visualization of the human colon. Surface rendering is sufficient for implementing such a procedure to obtain an overview of the interior surface of the colon at interactive rendering speeds. Unfortunately, physicians can not use it to explore tissues beneath the surface to differentiate between benign and malignant structures. In this paper, we present a direct volume rendering approach based on perspective ray casting, as a supplement to the surface navigation. To accelerate the rendering speed, surface-assistant techniques are used to adapt the resampling rates by skipping the empty space inside the colon. In addition, a parallel version of the algorithm has been implemented on a shared-memory multiprocessing architecture. Experiments have been conducted on both simulation and patient data sets.
This paper explores mapping strategies for generating LIC-like images from streamlines and streamline-like images from LIC. The main contribution of this paper is a technique which we call pseudo-LIC or PLIC. By adjusting a small set of key parameters, PLIC can generate flow visualizations that span the spectrum of streamline-like to LIC-like images. Among the advantages of PLIC are: image quality comparable with LIC, performance speedup over LIC, use of a template texture that is independent of the size of the flow field, handles the problem of multiple streamlines occupying the same pixel in image space, reduced aliasing, applicability to time varying data sets, and variable speed animation.
Presents a two-level approach for fusing direct volume rendering (DVR) and maximum-intensity projection (MIP) within a joint rendering method. Different structures within the data set are rendered locally by either MIP or DVR on an object-by-object basis. Globally, all the results of subsequent object renderings are combined in a merging step (usually compositing in our case). This allows us to selectively choose the most suitable technique for depicting each object within the data, while keeping the amount of information contained in the image at a reasonable level. This is especially useful when inner structures should be visualized together with semi-transparent outer parts, similar to the focus-and-context approach known from information visualization. We also present an implementation of our approach which allows us to explore volumetric data using two-level rendering at interactive frame rates.
Visualization of 3D tensor fields continues to be a major challenge in terms of providing intuitive and uncluttered images that allow the users to better understand their data. The primary focus of this paper is on finding a formulation that lends itself to a stable numerical algorithm for extracting stable and persistent topological features from 2nd order real symmetric 3D tensors. While features in 2D tensors can be identified as either wedge or trisector points, in 3D, the corresponding stable features are lines, not just points. These topological feature lines provide a compact representation of the 3D tensor field and are essential in helping scientists and engineers understand their complex nature. Existing techniques work by finding degenerate points and are not numerically stable, and worse, produce both false positive and false negative feature points. This work seeks to address this problem with a robust algorithm that can extract these features in a numerically stable, accurate, and complete manner.
Multi-projector displays show significant spatial variation in 3D color gamut due to variation in the chromaticity gamuts across the projectors, vignetting effect of each projector and also overlap across adjacent projectors. In this paper we present a new constrained gamut morphing algorithm that removes all these variations and results in true color seamlessness across tiled multi-projector displays. Our color morphing algorithm adjusts the intensities of light from each pixel of each projector precisely to achieve a smooth morphing from one projector's gamut to the other's through the overlap region. This morphing is achieved by imposing precise constraints on the perceptual difference between the gamuts of two adjacent pixels. In addition, our gamut morphing assures a C1 continuity yielding visually pleasing appearance across the entire display. We demonstrate our method successfully on a planar and a curved display using both low and high-end projectors. Our approach is completely scalable, efficient and automatic. We also demonstrate the real-time performance of our image correction algorithm on GPUs for interactive applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a scalable method with a strong foundation in perception and realizes, for the first time, a truly seamless display where the number of projectors cannot be deciphered.
We present a new algorithm to explore and visualize multivariate time-varying data sets. We identify important trend relationships among the variables based on how the values of the variables change over time and how those changes are related to each other in different spatial regions and time intervals. The trend relationships can be used to describe the correlation and causal effects among the different variables. To identify the temporal trends from a local region, we design a new algorithm called SUBDTW to estimate when a trend appears and vanishes in a given time series. Based on the beginning and ending times of the trends, their temporal relationships can be modeled as a state machine representing the trend sequence. Since a scientific data set usually contains millions of data points, we propose an algorithm to extract important trend relationships in linear time complexity. We design novel user interfaces to explore the trend relationships, to visualize their temporal characteristics, and to display their spatial distributions. We use several scientific data sets to test our algorithm and demonstrate its utilities.
In this paper we present a framework to define transfer functions from a target distribution provided by the user. A target distribution can reflect the data importance, or highly relevant data value interval, or spatial segmentation. Our approach is based on a communication channel between a set of viewpoints and a set of bins of a volume data set, and it supports 1D as well as 2D transfer functions including the gradient information. The transfer functions are obtained by minimizing the informational divergence or Kullback-Leibler distance between the visibility distribution captured by the viewpoints and a target distribution selected by the user. The use of the derivative of the informational divergence allows for a fast optimization process. Different target distributions for 1D and 2D transfer functions are analyzed together with importance-driven and view-based techniques.
Because of the ever increasing size of output data from scientific simulations, supercomputers are increasingly relied upon to generate visualizations. One use of supercomputers is to generate field lines from large scale flow fields. When generating field lines in parallel, the vector field is generally decomposed into blocks, which are then assigned to processors. Since various regions of the vector field can have different flow complexity, processors will require varying amounts of computation time to trace their particles, causing load imbalance, and thus limiting the performance speedup. To achieve load-balanced streamline generation, we propose a workload-aware partitioning algorithm to decompose the vector field into partitions with near equal workloads. Since actual workloads are unknown beforehand, we propose a workload estimation algorithm to predict the workload in the local vector field. A graph-based representation of the vector field is employed to generate these estimates. Once the workloads have been estimated, our partitioning algorithm is hierarchically applied to distribute the workload to all partitions. We examine the performance of our workload estimation and workload-aware partitioning algorithm in several timings studies, which demonstrates that by employing these methods, better scalability can be achieved with little overhead.
Visualization of CFD data for turbomachinery design poses some special requirements which are often not addressed by standard flow visualization systems. The authors discuss the issues involved with this particular application and its requirements with respect to flow visualization. Aiming at a feature-based visualization for this task, they examine various existing techniques to locate vortices. The specific flow conditions for turbomachines demonstrate limitations of current methods. Visualization of turbomachinery flow thus raises some challenges and research topics, particularly regarding feature extraction.
Vector field visualization is an important topic in scientific visualization. Its aim is to graphically represent field data in an intuitively understandable and precise way. Here a new approach based on anisotropic nonlinear diffusion is introduced. It enables an easy perception of flow data and serves as an appropriate scale space method for the visualization of complicated flow patterns. The approach is closely related to nonlinear diffusion methods in image analysis where images are smoothed while still retaining and enhancing edges. An initial noisy image is smoothed along streamlines, whereas the image is sharpened in the orthogonal direction. The method is based on a continuous model and requires the solution of a parabolic PDE problem. It is discretized only in the final implementational step. Therefore, many important qualitative aspects can already be discussed on a continuous level. Applications are shown in 2D and 3D and the provisions for flow segmentation are outlined.
We present an algorithm for compressing 2D vector fields that preserves topology. Our approach is to simplify the given data set using constrained clustering. We employ different types of global and local error metrics including the earth mover's distance metric to measure the degradation in topology as well as weighted magnitude and angular errors. As a result, we obtain precise error bounds in the compressed vector fields. Experiments with both analytic and simulated data sets are presented. Results indicate that one can obtain significant compression with low errors without losing topology information.
By offering more detail and precision, large data sets can provide greater insights to researchers than small data sets. However, these data sets require greater computing resources to view and manage. Remote visualization techniques allow the use of computers that cannot be operated locally. The Semotus Visum framework applies a high-performance client-server paradigm to the problem. The framework utilizes both client and server resources via multiple rendering methods. Experimental results show the framework delivers high frame rates and low latency across a wide range of data sets.
In this paper a novel volume-rendering technique based on Monte Carlo integration is presented. As a result of a preprocessing, a point cloud of random samples is generated using a normalized continuous reconstruction of the volume as a probability density function. This point cloud is projected onto the image plane, and to each pixel an intensity value is assigned which is proportional to the number of samples projected onto the corresponding pixel area. In such a way a simulated X-ray image of the volume can be obtained. Theoretically, for a fixed image resolution, there exists an M number of samples such that the average standard deviation of the estimated pixel intensities us under the level of quantization error regardless of the number of voxels. Therefore Monte Carlo Volume Rendering (MCVR) is mainly proposed to efficiently visualize large volume data sets. Furthermore, network applications are also supported, since the trade-off between image quality and interactivity can be adapted to the bandwidth of the client/server connection by using progressive refinement.
Gaining a comprehensive understanding of turbulent flows still poses one of the great challenges in fluid dynamics. A well-established approach to advance this research is the analysis of the vortex structures contained in the flow. In order to be able to perform this analysis efficiently, supporting visualization tools with clearly defined requirements are needed. In this paper, we present a visualization system which matches these requirements to a large extent. The system consists of two components. The first component analyzes the flow by means of a novel combination of vortex core line detection and the /spl lambda//sub 2/ method. The second component is a vortex browser which allows for an interactive exploration and manipulation of the vortices detected and separated during the first phase. Our system improves the reliability and applicability of existing vortex detection methods and allows for a more efficient study of vortical flows which is demonstrated in an evaluation performed by experts.
Maximum projection is a volume rendering technique that, for each pixel, finds the maximum intensity along a projector. For certain important classes of data, this is an approximation to summation rendering which produces superior visualizations. We show how maximum projection rendering with additional depth cues can be implemented using simple affine transformations in object space. This technique can be used together with 3D graphics libraries and standard graphics hardware, thus allowing interactive manipulations of the volume data. The algorithm presented allows for a wide range of tradeoffs between interactivity and image quality.
An algorithm for computing a triangulated surface which separates a collection of data points that have been segmented into a number of different classes is presented. The problem generalizes the concept of an isosurface which separates data points that have been segmented into only two classes: those for which data function values are above the threshold and those which are below the threshold value. The algorithm is very simple, easy to implement and applies without limit to the number of classes.
Large textures cause bottlenecks in real time applications that often lead to a loss of interactivity. These performance bottlenecks occur because of disk and network transfer, texture translation, and memory swapping. We present a software solution that alleviates the problems associated with large textures by treating texture as a bandwidth limited resource rather than a finite resource. As a result the display of large textures is reduced to a caching problem in which texture memory serves as the primary cache for texture data, main memory the secondary cache, and local disk the tertiary cache. By using this cache hierarchy, applications are able to maintain real time performance while displaying textures hundreds of times larger than can fit into texture memory.
Visual exploration of massive datasets arising from telecommunication networks and services is a challenge. This paper describes SWIFT-3D, an integrated data visualization and exploration system created at AT&amp;T Labs for large scale network analysis. SWIFT-3D integrates a collection of interactive tools that includes pixel-oriented 2D maps, interactive 3D maps, statistical displays, network topology diagrams and an interactive drill-down query interface. Example applications are described, demonstrating a successful application to analyze unexpected network events (high volumes of unanswered calls), and comparison of usage of an Internet service with voice network traffic and local access coverage.
We present a haptic rendering technique that uses directional constraints to facilitate enhanced exploration modes for volumetric datasets. The algorithm restricts user motion in certain directions by incrementally moving a proxy point along the axes of a local reference frame. Reaction forces are generated by a spring coupler between the proxy and the data probe, which can be tuned to the capabilities of the haptic interface. Secondary haptic effects including field forces, friction, and texture can be easily incorporated to convey information about additional characteristics of the data. We illustrate the technique with two examples: displaying fiber orientation in heart muscle layers and exploring diffusion tensor fiber tracts in brain white matter tissue. Initial evaluation of the approach indicates that haptic constraints provide an intuitive means or displaying directional information in volume data.
We address the texture level-of-detail problem for extremely large surfaces such as terrain during realtime, view-dependent rendering. A novel texture hierarchy is introduced based on 4-8 refinements of raster tiles, in which the texture grids in effect rotate 45 degrees for each level of refinement. This hierarchy provides twice as many levels of detail as conventional quadtree-style refinement schemes such as mipmaps, and thus provides per-pixel view-dependent filtering that is twice as close to the ideal cutoff frequency for an average pixel. Because of this more gradual change in low-pass filtering, and due to the more precise emulation of the ideal cutoff frequency, we find in practice that the transitions between texture levels of detail are not perceptible. This allows rendering systems to avoid the complexity and performance costs of per-pixel blending between texture levels of detail. The 4-8 texturing scheme is integrated into a variant of the real-time optimally adapting meshes (ROAM) algorithm for view-dependent multiresolution mesh generation. Improvements to ROAM included here are: the diamond data structure as a streamlined replacement for the triangle bintree elements, the use of low-pass-filtered geometry patches in place of individual triangles, integration of 4-8 textures, and a simple out-of-core data access mechanism for texture and geometry tiles.
We present a new particle tracing approach for the simulation of mid- and high-frequency sound. Inspired by the photorealism obtained by methods like photon mapping, we develop a similar method for the physical simulation of sound within rooms. For given source and listener positions, our method computes a finite-response filter accounting for the different reflections at various surfaces with frequency-dependent absorption coefficients. Convoluting this filter with an anechoic input signal reproduces a realistic aural impression of the simulated room. We do not consider diffraction effects due to low frequencies, since these can be better computed by finite elements. Our method allows the visualization of a wave front propagation using color-coded blobs traversing the paths of individual phonons.
In this paper, we present a user study in which we have investigated the influence of seven state-of-the-art volumetric illumination models on the spatial perception of volume rendered images. Within the study, we have compared gradient-based shading with half angle slicing, directional occlusion shading, multidirectional occlusion shading, shadow volume propagation, spherical harmonic lighting as well as dynamic ambient occlusion. To evaluate these models, users had to solve three tasks relying on correct depth as well as size perception. Our motivation for these three tasks was to find relations between the used illumination model, user accuracy and the elapsed time. In an additional task, users had to subjectively judge the output of the tested models. After first reviewing the models and their features, we will introduce the individual tasks and discuss their results. We discovered statistically significant differences in the testing performance of the techniques. Based on these findings, we have analyzed the models and extracted those features which are possibly relevant for the improved spatial comprehension in a relational task. We believe that a combination of these distinctive features could pave the way for a novel illumination model, which would be optimized based on our findings.
Blood flow and derived data are essential to investigate the initiation and progression of cerebral aneurysms as well as their risk of rupture. An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and-context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time. The FLOWLENS minimizes visual cluttering, occlusions, and provides a flexible exploration of a region of interest. We have applied our approach to seven representative datasets, including steady and unsteady flow data from CFD simulations and 4D PC-MRI measurements. Informal user interviews with three domain experts confirm the usefulness of our approach.
In this paper we describe a battlefield visualization system, called Dragon, which we have implemented on a virtual reality responsive workbench. The Dragon system has been successfully deployed as part of two large military exercises: the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment, in March 1997, and the Joint Counter Mine advanced concept tactical demonstration, in August and September 1997. We describe battlefield visualization, the Dragon system, and the workbench, and we describe our experiences as part of these two real-world deployments, with an emphasis on lessons learned and needed future work.
We propose a technique for visualizing steady flow. Using this technique, we first convert the vector field data into a scalar level-set representation. We then analyze the dynamic behavior and subsequent distortion of level-sets and interactively monitor the evolving structures by means of texture-based surface rendering. Next, we combine geometrical and topological considerations to derive a multiscale representation and to implement a method for the automatic placement of a sparse set of graphical primitives depicting homogeneous streams in the fields. Using the resulting algorithms, we have built a visualization system that enables us to effectively display the flow direction and its dynamics even for dense 3D fields.
We present a novel disk-based multiresolution triangle mesh data structure that supports paging and view-dependent rendering of very large meshes at interactive frame rates from external memory. Our approach, called XFastMesh, is based on a view-dependent mesh simplification framework that represents half-edge collapse operations in a binary hierarchy known as a merge-tree forest. The proposed technique partitions the merge-tree forest into so-called detail blocks, which consist of binary subtrees, that are stored on disk. We present an efficient external memory data structure and file format that stores all detail information of the multiresolution triangulation method using significantly less storage then previously reported approaches. Furthermore, we present a paging algorithm that provides efficient loading and interactive rendering of large meshes from external memory at varying and view-dependent level-of-detail. The presented approach is highly efficient both in terms of space cost and paging performance.
This paper presents a strategy for seeding streamlines in 3D flow fields. Its main goal is to capture the essential flow patterns and to provide sufficient coverage in the field while reducing clutter. First, critical points of the flow field are extracted to identify regions with important flow patterns that need to be presented. Different seeding templates are then used around the vicinity of the different critical points. Because there is significant variability in the flow pattern even for the same type of critical point, our template can change shape depending on how far the critical point is from transitioning into another type of critical point. To accomplish this, we introduce the /spl alpha/-/spl beta/ map of 3D critical points. Next, we use Poisson seeding to populate the empty regions. Finally, we filter the streamlines based on their geometric and spatial properties. Altogether, this multi-step strategy reduces clutter and yet captures the important 3D flow features.
We demonstrate the application of advanced 3D visualization techniques to determine the optimal implant design and position in hip joint replacement planning. Our methods take as input the physiological stress distribution inside a patient's bone under load and the stress distribution inside this bone under the same load after a simulated replacement surgery. The visualization aims at showing principal stress directions and magnitudes, as well as differences in both distributions. By visualizing changes of normal and shear stresses with respect to the principal stress directions of the physiological state, a comparative analysis of the physiological stress distribution and the stress distribution with implant is provided, and the implant parameters that most closely replicate the physiological stress state in order to avoid stress shielding can be determined. Our method combines volume rendering for the visualization of stress magnitudes with the tracing of short line segments for the visualization of stress directions. To improve depth perception, transparent, shaded, and antialiased lines are rendered in correct visibility order, and they are attenuated by the volume rendering. We use a focus+context approach to visually guide the user to relevant regions in the data, and to support a detailed stress analysis in these regions while preserving spatial context information. Since all of our techniques have been realized on the GPU, they can immediately react to changes in the simulated stress tensor field and thus provide an effective means for optimal implant selection and positioning in a computational steering environment.
Insight into the dynamics of blood-flow considerably improves the understanding of the complex cardiovascular system and its pathologies. Advances in MRI technology enable acquisition of 4D blood-flow data, providing quantitative blood-flow velocities over time. The currently typical slice-by-slice analysis requires a full mental reconstruction of the unsteady blood-flow field, which is a tedious and highly challenging task, even for skilled physicians. We endeavor to alleviate this task by means of comprehensive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present a framework for pre-clinical cardiovascular research, providing tools to both interactively explore the 4D blood-flow data and depict the essential blood-flow characteristics. The framework encompasses a variety of visualization styles, comprising illustrative techniques as well as improved methods from the established field of flow visualization. Each of the incorporated styles, including exploded planar reformats, flow-direction highlights, and arrow-trails, locally captures the blood-flow dynamics and may be initiated by an interactively probed vessel cross-section. Additionally, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, measuring the value of each of the visualization styles and related rendering parameters.
Acceleration is a fundamental quantity of flow fields that captures Galilean invariant properties of particle motion. Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.
Visualizing the third dimension while designing three-dimensional (3-D) objects is an awkward process in mechanical computer-aided-design (CAD) systems, given the current state of the art. The authors describe a computer system that automatically constructs the shape of a 3-D object from a single 2-D sketch. The method makes it convenient to create and manipulate 3-D objects, and is thus seen as an intelligent user interface for CAD and 3-D graphics applications. The proposed technique is built on well-known results in image analysis. These results are applied in conjunction with some perceptual rules to determine 3-D structure from a rough line drawing. The principles are illustrated by a computer implementation that works in a nontrivial object domain.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The visualization of 3-D second-order tensor fields and matrix data is studied. The general problem of visualizing unsymmetric real or complex Hermitian second-order tensor fields can be reduced to the simultaneous visualization of a real and symmetric second-order tensor field and a real vector field. The emphasis is on exploiting the mathematical properties of tensor fields in order to facilitate their visualization and to produce a continuous representation of the data. The focus is on interactively sensing and exploring real and symmetric second-order tensor data by generalizing the vector notion of streamline to the tensor concept of hyperstreamline. The importance of a structural analysis of the data field analogous to the techniques of vector field topology extraction in order to obtain a unique and objective representation of second-order tensor fields is stressed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volume rendering has been proposed as a useful tool for extracting information from large datasets, where non-visual analysis alone may not be feasible. The scale of these applications implies that data management is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Most volume rendering algorithms, however, process data in raw, uncompressed form. In previous work, we introduced a compressed volume format that may be volume rendered directly with minimal impact on rendering time. In this paper, we extend these ideas to a new volume format that not only reduces storage space and transmission time, but is designed for fast volume rendering as well. The volume dataset is represented as indices into a small codebook of representative blocks. With the data structure, volume shading calculations need only be performed on the codebook and image generation is accelerated by reusing precomputed block projections.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Navigation in computer generated information spaces may be difficult, resulting in users getting "lost in hyperspace". This work aims to build on research from the area of city planning to try to solve this problem. We introduce the concepts of legibility and cognitive maps and the five features of urban landscape with which they are associated. Following this will be descriptions of techniques and algorithms which we have developed to allow these features to be introduced to three dimensional spaces for information visualisation. Next we describe a specific application of these techniques in the visualisation of the World Wide Web and conclude with a look at future development of the system.
Some new piecewise constant wavelets defined over nested triangulated domains are presented and applied to the problem of multiresolution analysis of flow over a spherical domain. These new, nearly orthogonal wavelets have advantages over the existing weaker biorthogonal wavelets. In the planar case of uniform areas, the wavelets converge to one of two fully orthogonal Haar wavelets. These new, fully orthogonal wavelets are proven to be the only possible wavelets of this type.
In this paper we present a method to compute and visualize volumetric white matter connectivity in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) using a Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) solver on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Paths through the volume are assigned costs that are lower if they are consistent with the preferred diffusion directions. The proposed method finds a set of voxels in the DTI volume that contain paths between two regions whose costs are within a threshold of the optimal path. The result is a volumetric optimal path analysis, which is driven by clinical and scientific questions relating to the connectivity between various known anatomical regions of the brain. To solve the minimal path problem quickly, we introduce a novel numerical algorithm for solving H-J equations, which we call the fast iterative method (FIM). This algorithm is well-adapted to parallel architectures, and we present a GPU-based implementation, which runs roughly 50-100 times faster than traditional CPU-based solvers for anisotropic H-J equations. The proposed system allows users to freely change the endpoints of interesting pathways and to visualize the optimal volumetric path between them at an interactive rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on some synthetic and real DT-MRI datasets and compare the performance with existing methods.
This paper describes a method for constructing isosurface triangulations of sampled, volumetric, three-dimensional scalar fields. The resulting meshes consist of triangles that are of consistently high quality, making them well suited for accurate interpolation of scalar and vector-valued quantities, as required for numerous applications in visualization and numerical simulation. The proposed method does not rely on a local construction or adjustment of triangles as is done, for instance, in advancing wavefront or adaptive refinement methods. Instead, a system of dynamic particles optimally samples an implicit function such that the particles' relative positions can produce a topologically correct Delaunay triangulation. Thus, the proposed method relies on a global placement of triangle vertices. The main contributions of the paper are the integration of dynamic particles systems with surface sampling theory and PDE-based methods for controlling the local variability of particle densities, as well as detailing a practical method that accommodates Delaunay sampling requirements to generate sparse sets of points for the production of high-quality tessellations.
Visualization of volumetric data faces the difficult task of finding effective parameters for the transfer functions. Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures. We demonstrate our texture-based transfer function for direct volume rendering with synthetic and real-world medical data to show the strength of our technique.
Visual exploration is essential to the visualization and analysis of densely sampled 3D DTI fibers in biological speciments, due to the high geometric, spatial, and anatomical complexity of fiber tracts. Previous methods for DTI fiber visualization use zooming, color-mapping, selection, and abstraction to deliver the characteristics of the fibers. However, these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D representation containing a low-dimensional embedding of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the relationship between the fibers and removes the visual clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the fibers. This new interface allows the user to manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D embedded points and easily compare or validate his or her results in both domains. The implementation of the framework is GPU based to achieve real-time interaction. The framework was applied to several tasks, and the results show that our method reduces the user's workload in recognizing 3D DTI fibers and permits quick and accurate DTI fiber selection.
This paper presents a new algorithm for the calculation of stream surfaces for tetrahedral grids. It propagates the surface through the tetrahedra, one at a time, calculating the intersections with the tetrahedral faces. The method allows us to incorporate topological information from the cells, e.g. critical points. The calculations are based on barycentric coordinates, since this simplifies the theory and the algorithm. The stream surfaces are ruled surfaces inside each cell, and their construction starts with line segments on the faces. Our method supports the analysis of velocity fields resulting from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.
This paper presents an interactive visualization system, named WebSearchViz, for visualizing the Web search results and facilitating users' navigation and exploration. The metaphor in our model is the solar system with its planets and asteroids revolving around the sun. Location, color, movement, and spatial distance of objects in the visual space are used to represent the semantic relationships between a query and relevant Web pages. Especially, the movement of objects and their speeds add a new dimension to the visual space, illustrating the degree of relevance among a query and Web search results in the context of users' subjects of interest. By interacting with the visual space, users are able to observe the semantic relevance between a query and a resulting Web page with respect to their subjects of interest, context information, or concern. Users' subjects of interest can be dynamically changed, redefined, added, or deleted from the visual space
Centralized techniques have been used until now when automatically calibrating (both geometrically and photometrically) large high-resolution displays created by tiling multiple projectors in a 2D array. A centralized server managed all the projectors and also the camera(s) used to calibrate the display. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous distributed calibration methodology via a display unit called the plug-and-play projector (PPP). The PPP consists of a projector, camera, computation and communication unit, thus creating a self-sufficient module that enables an asynchronous distributed architecture for multi-projector displays. We present a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) calibration algorithm that runs on each PPP and achieves a truly scalable and reconfigurable display without any input from the user. It instruments novel capabilities like adding/removing PPPs from the display dynamically, detecting faults, and reshaping the display to a reasonable rectangular shape to react to the addition/removal/faults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to realize a completely asynchronous and distributed calibration architecture and methodology for multi-projector displays
Surface-particles are very small facets, modeled as points with a normal. They can be used to visualize flow in several ways by variation of the properties of the particle sources. A method is presented for the rendering of surface-particles. This method includes an improved shading model, the use of Gaussian filters for the prevention of spatial and temporal artifacts, an efficient scan-conversion algorithm, the handling of occlusion and the simultaneous rendering of geometric objects and surface-particles. The synthesis of images with limited depth of field is described, which literally allows the scientist to focus on areas of interest.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Making accurate computer graphics representations of surfaces and volumes (2-manifolds and 3-manifolds) embedded in four-dimensional space typically involves complex and time-consuming computations. In order to make simulated worlds that help develop human intuition about the fourth dimensions, we need techniques that permit real-time, interactive manipulation of the most sophisticated depictions available. We propose the following new methods that bring us significantly closer to this goal: an approach to high-speed 4D illuminated surface rendering incorporating 4D shading and occlusion coding; a procedure for rapidly generating 2D screen images of tessellated 3-manifolds illuminated by 4D light. These methods are orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, enabling the real-time manipulation of high-resolution 4D images on commercial graphics hardware.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The National Library of Medicine is creating a digital atlas of the human body. This project, called the Visible Human, has already produced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and physical cross-sections of a human male cadaver. This paper describes a methodology and results for extracting surfaces from the Visible Male's CT data. We use surface connectivity and isosurface extraction techniques to create polygonal models of the skin, bone, muscle and bowels. We also report early experiments with the physical cross-sections.
As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass-market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes, but as the number of nodes increases toward 5000, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which can contain between a million and a billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper presents some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8-wide-by-9-deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.
We discuss 3d interaction techniques for the quantitative analysis of spatial relations in medical visualizations. We describe the design and implementation of measurement tools to measure distances, angles and volumes in 3d visualizations. The visualization of measurement tools as recognizable 3d objects and a 3d interaction, which is both intuitive and precise, determines the usability of such facilities. Measurements may be carried out in 2d visualizations of the original radiological data and in 3d visualizations. The result of a measurement carried out in one view is also displayed in the other view appropriately. We discuss the validation of the obtained measures. Finally, we describe how some important measurement tasks may be solved automatically.
We present a novel surface reconstruction algorithm that can recover high-quality surfaces from noisy and defective data sets without any normal or orientation information. A set of new techniques is introduced to afford extra noise tolerability, robust orientation alignment, reliable outlier removal, and satisfactory feature recovery. In our algorithm, sample points are first organized by an octree. The points are then clustered into a set of monolithically singly-oriented groups. The inside/outside orientation of each group is determined through a robust voting algorithm. We locally fit an implicit quadric surface in each octree cell. The locally fitted implicit surfaces are then blended to produce a signed distance field using the modified Shepard's method. We develop sophisticated iterative fitting algorithms to afford improved noise tolerance both in topology recognition and geometry accuracy. Furthermore, this iterative fitting algorithm, coupled with a local model selection scheme, provides a reliable sharp feature recovery mechanism even in the presence of bad input.
Understanding fluid flow data, especially vortices, is still a challenging task. Sophisticated visualization tools help to gain insight. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.
We introduce local and global comparison measures for a collection of k /spl les/ d real-valued smooth functions on a common d-dimensional Riemannian manifold. For k = d = 2 we relate the measures to the set of critical points of one function restricted to the level sets of the other. The definition of the measures extends to piecewise linear functions for which they are easy to compute. The computation of the measures forms the centerpiece of a software tool which we use to study scientific datasets.
Diffusion tensor imaging is a magnetic resonance imaging method which has gained increasing importance in neuroscience and especially in neurosurgery. It acquires diffusion properties represented by a symmetric 2nd order tensor for each voxel in the gathered dataset. From the medical point of view, the data is of special interest due lo different diffusion characteristics of varying brain tissue allowing conclusions about the underlying structures such as while matter tracts. An obvious way to visualize this data is to focus on the anisotropic areas using the major eigenvector for tractography and rendering lines for visualization of the simulation results. Our approach extends this technique to avoid line representation since lines lead 10 very complex illustrations and furthermore are mistakable. Instead, we generate surfaces wrapping bundles of lines. Thereby, a more intuitive representation of different tracts is achieved.
Curve-skeletons are a 1D subset of the medial surface of a 3D object and are useful for many visualization tasks including virtual navigation, reduced-model formulation, visualization improvement, mesh repair, animation, etc. There are many algorithms in the literature describing extraction methodologies for different applications; however, it is unclear how general and robust they are. In this paper, we provide an overview of many curve-skeleton applications and compile a set of desired properties of such representations. We also give a taxonomy of methods and analyze the advantages and drawbacks of each class of algorithms.
A new type of glyph is introduced to visualize unsteady flow with static images, allowing easier analysis of time-dependent phenomena compared to animated visualization. Adopting the visual metaphor of radar displays, this glyph represents flow directions by angles and time by radius in spherical coordinates. Dense seeding of flow radar glyphs on the flow domain naturally lends itself to multi-scale visualization: zoomed-out views show aggregated overviews, zooming-in enables detailed analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics. Uncertainty visualization is supported by extending the glyph to display possible ranges of flow directions. The paper focuses on 2D flow, but includes a discussion of 3D flow as well. Examples from CFD and the field of stochastic hydrogeology show that it is easy to discriminate regions of different spatiotemporal flow behavior and regions of different uncertainty variations in space and time. The examples also demonstrate that parameter studies can be analyzed because the glyph design facilitates comparative visualization. Finally, different variants of interactive GPU-accelerated implementations are discussed.
A methodology has been developed for constructing streamlines and particle paths in numerically generated fluid velocity fields. A graphical technique is used to convert the discretely defined flow within a cell into one represented by two three-dimensional stream functions. Streamlines are calculated by tracking constant values of each stream function, a process which corresponds to finding the intersection of two stream surfaces. The tracking process is mass conservative and does not use a time stepping method for integration, thus eliminating a computationally intensive part of traditional tracking algorithms. The method can be applied generally to any three-dimensional compressible or incompressible steady flow. Results presented compare the performance of the new method to the most commonly used scheme and show that calculation times can be reduced by an order of magnitude.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volume rendering generates 2D images by ray tracing 3D volume data. This technique imposes considerable demands on storage space as the data set grows in size. In this paper, we describe a method to render compressed volume data directly to reduce the memory requirements of the rendering process. The volume data was compressed by a technique called the Laplacian pyramid. A compression ratio of 10:1 was achieved by uniform quantization over the Laplacian pyramid. The quality of the images obtained by this technique as virtually indistinguishable from that of the images generated from the uncompressed volume data. A significant improvement in computational performance was achieved by using a cache algorithm to temporarily retain the reconstructed voxels to be used by the adjacent rays.
We present a method for producing real-time volume visualizations of continuously captured, arbitrarily-oriented 2D arrays (slices) of data. Our system constructs a 3D representation on-the-fly from incoming 2D ultrasound slices by modeling and rendering the slices as planar polygons with translucent surface textures. We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non-intersecting, visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel, time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames. This technique is employed in a functioning real-time augmented reality system that a physician has used to examine human patients prior to breast biopsy procedures. We expect the technique can be used for real-time visualization of any 2D data being collected from a tracked sensor moving along an arbitrary path.
An isosurface can be efficiently generated by visiting adjacent intersected cells in order, as if the isosurface were propagating itself. We previously proposed an extrema graph method (T. Itoh and K. Koyamada, 1995), which generates a graph connecting extremum points. The isosurface propagation starts from some of the intersected cells that are found both by visiting the cells through which arcs of the graph pass and by visiting the cells on the boundary of a volume. We propose an efficient method of searching for cells intersected by an isosurface. This method generates a volumetric skeleton. consisting of cells, like an extrema graph, by applying a thinning algorithm used in the image recognition area. Since it preserves the topological features of the volume and the connectivity of the extremum points, it necessarily intersects every isosurface. The method is more efficient than the extrema graph method, since it does not require that cells on the boundary be visited.
In recent years scientific visualization has been driven by the need to visualize high-dimensional data sets within high-dimensional spaces. However most visualization methods are designed to show only some statistical features of the data set. The paper deals with the visualization of trajectories of high-dimensional dynamical systems which form a L/sub n//sup n/ data set of a smooth n-dimensional flow. Three methods that are based on the idea of parallel coordinates are presented and discussed. Visualizations done with these new methods are shown and an interactive visualization tool for the exploration of high-dimensional dynamical systems is proposed.
Presents a new approach to isosurface extraction from volume data using particle systems. Particle behavior is dynamic and can be based on laws of physics or artificial rules. For isosurface extraction, we program particles to be attracted towards a specific surface value while simultaneously repelling adjacent particles. The repulsive forces are based on the curvature of the surface at that location. A birth-death process results in a denser concentration of particles in areas of high curvature and sparser populations in areas of lower curvature. The overall level of detail is controlled through a scaling factor that increases or decreases the repulsive forces of the particles. Once particles reach equilibrium, their locations are used as vertices in generating a triangular mesh of the surface. The advantages of our approach include: vertex densities are based on surface features rather than on the sampling rate of the volume; a single scaling factor simplifies level-of-detail control; and meshing is efficient because it uses neighbor information that has already been generated during the force calculations.
We describe a framework for time-critical rendering of graphics scenes composed of a large number of objects having complex geometric descriptions. Our technique relies upon a scene description in which objects are represented as multiresolution meshes. We perform a constrained optimization at each frame to choose the resolution of each potentially visible object that generates the best quality image while meeting timing constraints. The technique provides smooth level-of-detail control and aims at guaranteeing a uniform, bounded frame rate even for widely changing viewing conditions. The optimization algorithm is independent from the particular data structure used to represent multiresolution meshes. The only requirements are the ability to represent a mesh with an arbitrary number of triangles and to traverse a mesh structure at an arbitrary resolution in a short predictable time. A data structure satisfying these criteria is described and experimental results are discussed.
Presents the results of an evaluation of the ARCHAVE (ARCHAeological Virtual Environment) system, an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment for archaeological research. ARCHAVE is implemented in a Cave. The evaluation studied researchers analyzing lamp and coin finds throughout the excavation trenches at the Petra Great Temple site in Jordan. Experienced archaeologists used our system to study excavation data, confirming existing hypotheses and postulating new theories they had not been able to discover without the system. ARCHAVE provided access to the excavation database, and researchers were able to examine the data in the context of a life-size representation of the present-day architectural ruins of the temple. They also had access to a miniature model for site-wide analysis. Because users quickly became comfortable with the interface, they concentrated their efforts on examining the data being retrieved and displayed. The immersive VR visualization of the recovered information gave them the opportunity to explore it in a new and dynamic way and, in several cases, enabled them to make discoveries that opened new lines of investigation about the excavation.
Finding the "best" viewing parameters for a scene is a difficult but very important problem. Fully automatic procedures seem to be impossible as the notion of "best" strongly depends on human judgment as well as on the application. In this paper a solution to the sub-problem of placing light sources for given camera parameters is proposed. A light position is defined to be optimal, when the resulting illumination reveals more about the scene than illuminations from all other light positions, i.e. the light position maximizes information that is added to the image through the illumination. With the help of an experiment with several subjects we could adapt the information measure to the actually perceived information content. We present fast global optimization procedures and solutions for two and more light sources.
Comparative evaluation of visualization and experimental results is a critical step in computational steering. In this paper, we present a study of image comparison metrics for quantifying the magnitude of difference between visualization of a computer simulation and a photographic image captured from an experiment. We examined eleven metrics, including three spatial domain, four spatial-frequency domain and four HVS (human-vision system) metrics. Among these metrics, a spatial-frequency domain metric called 2nd-order Fourier comparison was proposed specifically for this work. Our study consisted of two stages: base cases and field trials. The former is a general study on a controlled comparison space using purposely selected data, and the latter involves imagery results from computational fluid dynamics and a rheological experiment. This study has introduced a methodological framework for analyzing image-level methods used in comparative visualization. For the eleven metrics considered, it has offered a set of informative indicators as to the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. In particular, we have identified three image comparison metrics that are effective in separating "similar" and "different" image groups. Our 2nd-order Fourier comparison metric has compared favorably with others in two of the three tests, and has shown its potential to be used for steering computer simulation quantitatively.
This paper presents a shading model for volumetric data which enhances the perception of surfaces within the volume. The model incorporates uniform diffuse illumination, which arrives equally from all directions at each surface point in the volume. This illumination is attenuated by occlusions in the local vicinity of the surface point, resulting in shadows in depressions and crevices. Experiments by other authors have shown that perception of a surface is superior under uniform diffuse lighting, compared to illumination from point source lighting.
This paper describes a novel method for creating surface models of multi-material components using dual energy computed tomography (DECT). The application scenario is metrology and dimensional measurement in industrial high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DCT). Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision, blurry, high energy dataset while the sharp edges are adopted and fused into the resulting image from the high precision, crisp, low energy dataset. In the final step a reliable surface model is extracted from the fused dataset using a local adaptive technique. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a specific workflow for dimensional measurements of multi-material industrial components, which takes two X-ray CT datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses into account. The performance of the workflow is discussed using a test specimen as well as two real world industrial parts. As result, a significant improvement in overall measurement precision, surface geometry and mean deviation to reference measurement compared to single exposure scans was facilitated.
Particle systems have gained importance as a methodology for sampling implicit surfaces and segmented objects to improve mesh generation and shape analysis. We propose that particle systems have a significantly more general role in sampling structure from unsegmented data. We describe a particle system that computes samplings of crease features (i.e. ridges and valleys, as lines or surfaces) that effectively represent many anatomical structures in scanned medical data. Because structure naturally exists at a range of sizes relative to the image resolution, computer vision has developed the theory of scale-space, which considers an n-D image as an (n + 1)-D stack of images at different blurring levels. Our scale-space particles move through continuous four-dimensional scale-space according to spatial constraints imposed by the crease features, a particle-image energy that draws particles towards scales of maximal feature strength, and an inter-particle energy that controls sampling density in space and scale. To make scale-space practical for large three-dimensional data, we present a spline-based interpolation across scale from a small number of pre-computed blurrings at optimally selected scales. The configuration of the particle system is visualized with tensor glyphs that display information about the local Hessian of the image, and the scale of the particle. We use scale-space particles to sample the complex three-dimensional branching structure of airways in lung CT, and the major white matter structures in brain DTI.
The authors discuss FAST (flow analysis software toolkit), an implementation of a software system for fluid mechanics analysis. Visualization of computational aerodynamics requires flexible, extensible, and adaptable software tools for performing analysis tasks. An overview of FAST is given, and its architecture is discussed. Interactive visualization control is addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of FAST are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The VIS-5D system provides highly interactive visual access to five-dimensional data sets containing up to 50 million data points. VIS-5D runs on the Stardent ST-1000 and ST-2000 workstations and generates animated three-dimensional graphics from gridded data sets in real time. It provides a widget-based user interface and fast visual response which allows scientists to interactively explore their data sets. VIS-5D generates literal and intuitive depictions of data, has user controls that are data oriented rather than graphics oriented, and provides a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) response. The result is a system that enables scientists to produce and direct their own animations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present an acceleration method for volumetric ray tracing which utilizes standard graphics hardware without compromising image accuracy. The graphics hardware is employed to identify those segments of each ray that could possibly contribute to the final image. A volumetric ray tracing algorithm is then used to compute the final image, traversing only the identified segments of the rays. This technique can be used to render volumetric isosurfaces as well as translucent volumes. In addition, this method can accelerate the traversal of shadow rays when performing recursive ray tracing.
This paper presents an analysis of progress in the use of sound as a tool in support of visualisation and gives an insight into its development and future needs. Special emphasis is given to the use of sound in scientific and engineering applications. A system developed to support surface data presentation and interaction by using sound is presented and discussed.
We propose a novel approach for segmentation and digital cleansing of endoscopic organs. Our method can be used for a variety of segmentation needs with little or no modification. It aims at fulfilling the dual and often conflicting requirements of a fast and accurate segmentation and also eliminates the undesirable partial volume effect which contemporary approaches cannot. For segmentation and digital cleansing, we use the peculiar characteristics exhibited by the intersection of any two distinct-intensity regions. To detect these intersections we cast rays through the volume, which we call the segmentation rays as they assist in the segmentation. We then associate a certain task of reconstruction and classification with each intersection the ray detects. We further use volumetric contrast enhancement to reconstruct surface lost by segmentation (if any), which aids in improving the quality of the volume rendering.
We have developed a fast, perceptual method for selecting color scales for data visualization that takes advantage of our sensitivity to luminance variations in human faces. To do so, we conducted experiments in which we mapped various color scales onto the intensity values of a digitized photograph of a face and asked observers to rate each image. We found a very strong correlation between the perceived naturalness of the images and the degree to which the underlying color scales increased monotonically in luminance. Color scales that did not include a monotonically increasing luminance component produced no positive rating scores. Since color scales with monotonic luminance profiles are widely recommended for visualizing continuous scalar data, a purely visual technique for identifying such color scales could be very useful, especially in situations where color calibration is not integrated into the visualization environment, such as over the Internet.
This paper deals with vessel exploration based on computed tomography angiography. Large image sequences of the lower extremities are investigated in a clinical environment. Two different approaches for peripheral vessel diagnosis dealing with stenosis and calcification detection are introduced. The paper presents an automated vessel-tracking tool for curved planar reformation. An interactive segmentation tool for bone removal is proposed.
The evolving technology of computer auto-fabrication ("3D printing") now makes it possible to produce physical models for complex biological molecules and assemblies. We report on an application that demonstrates the use of auto-fabricated tangible models and augmented reality for research and education in molecular biology, and for enhancing the scientific environment for collaboration and exploration. We have adapted an augmented reality system to allow virtual 3D representations (generated by the Python Molecular Viewer) to be overlaid onto a tangible molecular model. Users can easily change the overlaid information, switching between different representations of the molecule, displays of molecular properties such as electrostatics, or dynamic information. The physical model provides a powerful, intuitive interface for manipulating the computer models, streamlining the interface between human intent, the physical model, and the computational activity.
We present a novel pipeline for computer-aided detection (CAD) of colonic polyps by integrating texture and shape analysis with volume rendering and conformal colon flattening. Using our automatic method, the 3D polyp detection problem is converted into a 2D pattern recognition problem. The colon surface is first segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the patient's abdomen, which is then mapped to a 2D rectangle using conformal mapping. This flattened image is rendered using a direct volume rendering technique with a translucent electronic biopsy transfer function. The polyps are detected by a 2D clustering method on the flattened image. The false positives are further reduced by analyzing the volumetric shape and texture features. Compared with shape based methods, our method is much more efficient without the need of computing curvature and other shape parameters for the whole colon surface. The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view. The proposed automatic CAD pipeline is incorporated into an interactive VC system, with a goal of helping radiologists detect polyps faster and with higher accuracy
Much of the visualization research has focused on improving the rendering quality and speed, and enhancing the perceptibility of features in the data. Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on focus+context (F+C) techniques (e.g., fisheye views and magnification lens) for data exploration in addition to viewing transformation and hierarchical navigation. However, most of the existing data exploration techniques rely on the manipulation of viewing attributes of the rendering system or optical attributes of the data objects, with users being passive viewers. In this paper, we propose a more active approach to data exploration, which attempts to mimic how we would explore data if we were able to hold it and interact with it in our hands. This involves allowing the users to physically or actively manipulate the geometry of a data object. While this approach has been traditionally used in applications, such as surgical simulation, where the original geometry of the data objects is well understood by the users, there are several challenges when this approach is generalized for applications, such as flow and information visualization, where there is no common perception as to the normal or natural geometry of a data object. We introduce a taxonomy and a set of transformations especially for illustrative deformation of general data exploration. We present combined geometric or optical illustration operators for focus+context visualization, and examine the best means for preventing the deformed context from being misperceived. We demonstrated the feasibility of this generalization with examples of flow, information and video visualization.
Multi-projector displays today are automatically registered, both geometrically and photometrically, using cameras. Existing registration techniques assume pre-calibrated projectors and cameras that are devoid of imperfections such as lens distortion. In practice, however, these devices are usually imperfect and uncalibrated. Registration of each of these devices is often more challenging than the multi-projector display registration itself. To make tiled projection-based displays accessible to a layman user we should allow the use of uncalibrated inexpensive devices that are prone to imperfections. In this paper, we make two important advances in this direction. First, we present a new geometric registration technique that can achieve geometric alignment in the presence of severe projector lens distortion using a relatively inexpensive low-resolution camera. This is achieved via a closed-form model that relates the projectors to cameras, in planar multi-projector displays, using rational Bezier patches. This enables us to geometrically calibrate a 3000 times 2500 resolution planar multi-projector display made of 3 times 3 array of nine severely distorted projectors using a low resolution (640 times 480) VGA camera. Second, we present a photometric self-calibration technique for a projector-camera pair. This allows us to photometrically calibrate the same display made of nine projectors using a photometrically uncalibrated camera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows geometrically imperfect projectors and photometrically uncalibrated cameras in calibrating multi-projector displays.
We present an interactive framework for exploring space-time and form-function relationships in experimentally collected high-resolution biomechanical data sets. These data describe complex 3D motions (e.g. chewing, walking, flying) performed by animals and humans and captured via high-speed imaging technologies, such as biplane fluoroscopy. In analyzing these 3D biomechanical motions, interactive 3D visualizations are important, in particular, for supporting spatial analysis. However, as researchers in information visualization have pointed out, 2D visualizations can also be effective tools for multi-dimensional data analysis, especially for identifying trends over time. Our approach, therefore, combines techniques from both 3D and 2D visualizations. Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs. Interactive exploration of data describing a collection of more than one hundred experimentally captured pig chewing cycles is described.
Reconstruction is used frequently in visualization of one, two, and three dimensional data. Data uncertainty is typically ignored, and a deficiency of many interpolation schemes is smoothing which may indicate features or characteristics of the data that are not there. The author investigates the use of iterated function systems (IFS's) for interpolation. He shows new derivations for fractal interpolation in two and three dimensional scalar data, and new point and polytope rendering algorithms with tremendous speed advantages over ray tracing. The interpolations may be used to give an indication of the uncertainty of the data, statistically represent the data at a variety of scales, allow tunability from the data, and may allow more accurate data analysis.
Computational steering is the ultimate goal of interactive simulation: researchers change parameters of their simulation and immediately receive feedback on the effect. We present a general and flexible graphics tool that is part of an environment for computational steering developed at CWI. It enables the researcher to interactively develop his own interface with the simulation. This interface is constructed with 3D parametrized geometric objects. The properties of the objects are parametrized to output data and input parameters of the simulation. The objects visualize the output of the simulation, while the researcher can steer the simulation by direct manipulation of the objects. Several applications of 3D computational steering are presented.
A general volume rendering technique is described that efficiently produces images of excellent quality from data defined over irregular grids having a wide variety of formats. Rendering is done in software, eliminating the need for special graphics hardware, as well as any artifacts associated with graphics hardware. Images of volumes with about 1,000,000 cells can be produced in one to several minutes on a workstation with a 150-MHz processor. A significant advantage of this method for applications such as computational fluid dynamics is that it can process multiple intersecting grids. Such grids present problems for most current volume rendering techniques. Also, the wide range of cell sizes does not present difficulties, as it does for many techniques. A spatial hierarchical organization makes it possible to access data from a restricted region efficiently. The tree has greater depth in regions of greater detail, determined by the number of cells in the region. It also makes it possible to render useful "preview" images very quickly by displaying each region associated with a tree node as one cell. Previews show enough detail to navigate effectively in very large data sets. The algorithmic techniques include use of a k-d tree, with prefix-order partitioning of triangles, to reduce the number of primitives that must be processed for one rendering, coarse-grain parallelism for a shared-memory MIMD architecture, a new perspective transformation that achieves greater numerical accuracy, and a scanline algorithm with depth sorting and a new clipping technique.
This paper presents efficient image-based rendering techniques used in the context of an architectural walkthrough system. Portals (doors and windows) are rendered by warping layered depth images (LDIs). In a preprocessing phase, for every portal, a number of pre-rendered images are combined into an LDI. The resulting LDI stores, exactly once, all surfaces visible in at least one of the images used in the construction, so most of the exposure errors are efficiently eliminated. The LDI can be warped in the McMillan occlusion compatible ordering. A substantial increase in performance is obtained by warping in parallel. Our parallelization scheme achieves good load balancing, scales with the number of processors, and preserves the occlusion compatible ordering. A fast, conservative reference-image-space clipping algorithm also reduces the warping effort.
Computer simulation and digital measuring systems are now generating data of unprecedented size. The size of data is becoming so large that conventional visualization tools are incapable of processing it, which is in turn is impacting the effectiveness of computational tools. In this paper we describe an object-oriented architecture that addresses this problem by automatically breaking data into pieces, and then processes the data piece-by-piece within a pipeline of filters. The piece size is user specified and can be controlled to eliminate the need for swapping (i.e., relying on virtual memory). In addition, because piece size can be controlled, any size problem can be run on any size computer, at the expense of extra computational time. Furthermore pieces are automatically broken into sub-pieces and each piece assigned to a different thread for parallel processing. This paper includes numerical performance studies and references to the source code which is freely available on the Web.
As the size and complexity of data sets continues to increase, the development of user interfaces and interaction techniques that expedite the process of exploring that data must receive new attention. Regardless of the speed of rendering, it is important to coherently organize the visual process of exploration: this information both grants insights about the data to a user and can be used by collaborators to understand the results. To fulfil these needs, we present a spreadsheet-like interface to data exploration. The interface displays a 2-dimensional window into visualization parameter space which users manipulate as they search for desired results. Through tabular organization and a clear correspondence between parameters and results, the interface eases the discovery, comparison and analysis of the underlying data. Users can utilize operators and the integrated interpreter to further explore and automate the visualization process; using a method introduced in this paper, these operations can be applied to cells in different stacks of the interface. Via illustrations using a variety of data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of this novel interface.
Distance fields are an important volume representation. A high quality distance field facilitates accurate surface characterization and gradient estimation. However, due to Nyquist's law, no existing volumetric methods based on the linear sampling theory can fully capture surface details, such as comers and edges, in 3D space. We propose a novel complete distance field representation (CDFR) that does not rely on Nyquist's sampling theory. To accomplish this, we construct a volume where each voxel has a complete description of all portions of surface that affect the local distance field. For any desired distance, we are able to extract a surface contour in true Euclidean distance, at any level of accuracy, from the same CDFR representation. Such point-based iso-distance contours have faithful per-point gradients and can be interactively visualized using splatting, providing per-point shaded image quality. We also demonstrate applying CDFR to a cutting edge design for manufacturing application involving high-complexity parts at unprecedented accuracy using only commonly available computational resources.
Acceleration techniques for volume ray-casting are primarily based on pre-computed data structures that allow one to efficiently traverse empty or homogeneous regions. In order to display volume data that successively undergoes color lookups, however, the data structures have to be re-built continuously. In this paper we propose a technique that circumvents this drawback using hardware accelerated texture mapping. In a first rendering pass we employ graphics hardware to interactively determine for each ray where the material is hit. In a second pass ray-casting is performed, but ray traversal starts right in front of the previously determined regions. The algorithm enables interactive classification and it considerably accelerates the view dependent display of selected materials and surfaces from volume data. In contrast to other techniques that are solely based on texture mapping our approach requires less memory and accurately performs the composition of material contributions along the ray.
For some graphics applications, object interiors and hard-to-see regions contribute little to the final images and need not be processed. In this paper, we define a view-independent visibility measure on mesh surfaces based on the visibility function between the surfaces and a surrounding sphere of cameras. We demonstrate the usefulness of this measure with a visibility-guided simplification algorithm. Mesh simplification reduces the polygon counts of 3D models and speeds up the rendering process. Many mesh simplification algorithms are based on sequences of edge collapses that minimize geometric and attribute errors. By combining the surface visibility measure with a geometric error measure, we obtain simplified models with improvement proportional to the number of low visibility regions in the original models.
We present empirical studies that consider the effects of stereopsis and simulated aerial perspective on depth perception in translucent volumes. We consider a purely absorptive lighting model, in which light is not scattered or reflected, but is simply absorbed as it passes through the volume. A purely absorptive lighting model is used, for example, when rendering digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), which are synthetic X-ray images reconstructed from CT volumes. Surgeons make use of DRRs in planning and performing operations, so an improvement of depth perception in DRRs may help diagnosis and surgical planning
This paper presents a novel method for interactive exploration of industrial CT volumes such as cast metal parts, with the goal of interactively detecting, classifying, and quantifying features using a visualization-driven approach. The standard approach for defect detection builds on region growing, which requires manually tuning parameters such as target ranges for density and size, variance, as well as the specification of seed points. If the results are not satisfactory, region growing must be performed again with different parameters. In contrast, our method allows interactive exploration of the parameter space, completely separated from region growing in an unattended pre-processing stage. The pre-computed feature volume tracks a feature size curve for each voxel over time, which is identified with the main region growing parameter such as variance. A novel 3D transfer function domain over (density, feature.size, time) allows for interactive exploration of feature classes. Features and feature size curves can also be explored individually, which helps with transfer function specification and allows coloring individual features and disabling features resulting from CT artifacts. Based on the classification obtained through exploration, the classified features can be quantified immediately.
In the last five years, there has been numerous applications of wavelets and multiresolution analysis in many fields of computer graphics as different as geometric modelling, volume visualization or illumination modelling. Classical multiresolution analysis is based on the knowledge of a nested set of functional spaces in which the successive approximations of a given function converge to that function, and can be efficiently computed. This paper first proposes a theoretical framework which enables multiresolution analysis even if the functional spaces are not nested, as long as they still have the property that the successive approximations converge to the given function. Based on this concept, we finally introduce a new multiresolution analysis with exact reconstruction for large data sets defined on uniform grids. We construct a one-parameter family of multiresolution analyses which is a blending of Haar and linear multiresolution, using BLaC (Blending of Linear and Constant) wavelets.
Rendering deformable volume data currently needs separate processes for deformation and rendering, and is expensive in terms of both computational and memory costs. Recognizing the importance of unifying these processes, we present a new approach to the direct rendering of deformable volumes without explicitly constructing the intermediate deformed volumes. The volume deformation is done by a radial basis function that is piecewise linearly approximated by an adaptive subdivision of the octree encoded target volume. The octree blocks in the target volume are then projected, reverse morphed and texture mapped, using the SGI 3D texture mapping hardware, in a back-to-front order. A template-based Z-plane/block intersection method is used to expedite the block projection computation.
The paper describes time management and time critical computing for a near real time interactive unsteady visualization environment. Subtle issues regarding the flow of time are described, formalized and addressed. The resulting system correctly reflects time behavior while allowing the user to control the flow of time. The problem of time critical computation is discussed and a solution is presented. These time critical algorithms provide control over the frame rate of a visualization system, allowing interactive exploration.
We present a method to code the multiresolution structure of a 3D triangle mesh in a manner that allows progressive decoding and efficient rendering at a client machine. The code is based on a special ordering of the mesh vertices which has good locality and continuity properties, inducing a natural multiresolution structure. This ordering also incorporates information allowing efficient rendering of the mesh at all resolutions using the contemporary vertex buffer mechanism. The performance of our code is shown to be competitive with existing progressive mesh compression methods, while achieving superior rendering speed.

We present a tool for real-time visualization of motion features in 2D image sequences. The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization, taking advantage of the parallelism in the graphics processor and the superior memory bandwidth. The integration of data processing and visualization also saves on unnecessary data transfers and thus allows the real-time analysis of 320/spl times/240 images. We expect that on the newest generation of graphics hardware our tool could run in real time for the standard VGA format.
Proteins are highly flexible and large amplitude deformations of their structure, also called slow dynamics, are often decisive to their function. We present a two-level rendering approach that enables visualization of slow dynamics of large protein assemblies. Our approach is aligned with a hierarchical model of large scale molecules. Instead of constantly updating positions of large amounts of atoms, we update the position and rotation of residues, i.e., higher level building blocks of a protein. Residues are represented by one vertex only indicating its position and additional information defining the rotation. The atoms in the residues are generated on-the-fly on the GPU, exploiting the new graphics hardware geometry shader capabilities. Moreover, we represent the atoms by billboards instead of tessellated spheres. Our representation is then significantly faster and pixel precise. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach in the context of our collaborative bioinformatics project.
We introduce a versatile framework for characterizing and extracting salient structures in three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensor fields. The key insight is that degenerate lines in tensor fields, as defined by the standard topological approach, are exactly crease (ridge and valley) lines of a particular tensor invariant called mode. This reformulation allows us to apply well-studied approaches from scientific visualization or computer vision to the extraction of topological lines in tensor fields. More generally, this main result suggests that other tensor invariants, such as anisotropy measures like fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used in the same framework in lieu of mode to identify important structural properties in tensor fields. Our implementation addresses the specific challenge posed by the non-linearity of the considered scalar measures and by the smoothness requirement of the crease manifold computation. We use a combination of smooth reconstruction kernels and adaptive refinement strategy that automatically adjust the resolution of the analysis to the spatial variation of the considered quantities. Together, these improvements allow for the robust application of existing ridge line extraction algorithms in the tensor context of our problem. Results are proposed for a diffusion tensor MRI dataset, and for a benchmark stress tensor field used in engineering research.
In this paper we investigate scalability limitations in the visualization of large-scale particle-based cosmological simulations, and we present methods to reduce these limitations on current PC architectures. To minimize the amount of data to be streamed from disk to the graphics subsystem, we propose a visually continuous level-of-detail (LOD) particle representation based on a hierarchical quantization scheme for particle coordinates and rules for generating coarse particle distributions. Given the maximal world space error per level, our LOD selection technique guarantees a sub-pixel screen space error during rendering. A brick-based page-tree allows to further reduce the number of disk seek operations to be performed. Additional particle quantities like density, velocity dispersion, and radius are compressed at no visible loss using vector quantization of logarithmically encoded floating point values. By fine-grain view-frustum culling and presence acceleration in a geometry shader the required geometry throughput on the GPU can be significantly reduced. We validate the quality and scalability of our method by presenting visualizations of a particle-based cosmological dark-matter simulation exceeding 10 billion elements.
The semi-transparent nature of direct volume rendered images is useful to depict layered structures in a volume. However, obtaining a semi-transparent result with the layers clearly revealed is difficult and may involve tedious adjustment on opacity and other rendering parameters. Furthermore, the visual quality of layers also depends on various perceptual factors. In this paper, we propose an auto-correction method for enhancing the perceived quality of the semi-transparent layers in direct volume rendered images. We introduce a suite of new measures based on psychological principles to evaluate the perceptual quality of transparent structures in the rendered images. By optimizing rendering parameters within an adaptive and intuitive user interaction process, the quality of the images is enhanced such that specific user requirements can be met. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.
Direct volume rendering and isosurfacing are ubiquitous rendering techniques in scientific visualization, commonly employed in imaging 3D data from simulation and scan sources. Conventionally, these methods have been treated as separate modalities, necessitating different sampling strategies and rendering algorithms. In reality, an isosurface is a special case of a transfer function, namely a Dirac impulse at a given isovalue. However, artifact-free rendering of discrete isosurfaces in a volume rendering framework is an elusive goal, requiring either infinite sampling or smoothing of the transfer function. While preintegration approaches solve the most obvious deficiencies in handling sharp transfer functions, artifacts can still result, limiting classification. In this paper, we introduce a method for rendering such features by explicitly solving for isovalues within the volume rendering integral. In addition, we present a sampling strategy inspired by ray differentials that automatically matches the frequency of the image plane, resulting in fewer artifacts near the eye and better overall performance. These techniques exhibit clear advantages over standard uniform ray casting with and without preintegration, and allow for high-quality interactive volume rendering with sharp C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; transfer functions.
Data flow visual language systems are being used to provide sophisticated environments for the visualization of scientific data. These systems are evolving rapidly and are beginning to encompass related technologies such as distributed computing and user interface development systems. A hierarchical classification of the components and issues involved is presented, giving an understanding of the design decisions and trade-offs that the developers of these systems are making. The component categories can be used as a framework for discussing where interoperability of competing visual programming environments might occur and what the future holds for these systems.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A technique for defining graphical depictions for all the data types defined in an algorithm is presented. The ability to display arbitrary combinations of an algorithm's data objects in a common frame of reference, coupled with interactive control of algorithm execution, provides a powerful way to understand algorithm behavior. Type definitions are constrained so that all primitive values occurring in data objects are assigned scalar types. A graphical display, including user interaction with the display, is modeled by a special data type. Mappings from the scalar types into the display model type provide a simple user interface for controlling how all data types are depicted, without the need for type-specific graphics logic.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volumetric data sets require enormous storage capacity even at moderate resolution levels. The excessive storage demands not only stress the capacity of the underlying storage and communications systems, but also seriously limit the speed of volume rendering due to data movement and manipulation. A novel volumetric data visualization scheme is proposed and implemented in this work that renders 2D images directly from compressed 3D data sets. The novelty of this algorithm is that rendering is performed on the compressed representation of the volumetric data without pre-decompression. As a result, the overheads associated with both data movement and rendering processing are significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm generalizes previously proposed whole-volume frequency-domain rendering schemes by first dividing the 3D data set into subcubes, transforming each subcube to a frequency-domain representation, and applying the Fourier projection theorem to produce the projected 2D images according to given viewing angles. Compared to the whole-volume approach, the subcube-based scheme not only achieves higher compression efficiency by exploiting local coherency, but also improves the quality of resultant rendering images because it approximates the occlusion effect on a subcube by subcube basis.
We explore the potential of information visualization techniques in enhancing existing methodologies for domain analysis and modeling. In this case study, we particularly focus on visualizing the evolution of the hypertext field based on author co-citation patterns, including the use of a sliding-window scheme to generate a series of annual snapshots of the domain structure, and a factor-referenced color-coding scheme to highlight predominant specialties in the field.
We present a new technique for visualizing surfaces from 3D ultrasound data. 3D ultrasound datasets are typically fuzzy, contain a substantial amount of noise and speckle, and suffer from several other problems that make extraction of continuous and smooth surfaces extremely difficult. We propose a novel opacity classification algorithm for 3D ultrasound datasets, based on the variational principle. More specifically, we compute a volumetric opacity function that optimally satisfies a set of simultaneous requirements. One requirement makes the function attain nonzero values only in the vicinity of a user-specified value, resulting in soft shells of finite, approximately constant thickness around isosurfaces in the volume. Other requirements are designed to make the function smoother and less sensitive to noise and speckle. The computed opacity function lends itself well to explicit geometric surface extraction, as well as to direct volume rendering at interactive rates. We also describe a new splatting algorithm that is particularly well suited for displaying soft opacity shells. Several examples and comparisons are included to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on real 3D ultrasound datasets.
In this paper, we show that histograms represent spatial function distributions with a nearest neighbour interpolation. We confirm that this results in systematic underrepresentation of transitional features of the data, and provide new insight why this occurs. We further show that isosurface statistics, which use higher quality interpolation, give better representations of the function distribution. We also use our experimentally collected isosurface statistics to resolve some questions as to the formal complexity of isosurfaces
Fiber tracking of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data offers a unique insight into the three-dimensional organisation of white matter structures in the living brain. However, fiber tracking algorithms require a number of user-defined input parameters that strongly affect the output results. Usually the fiber tracking parameters are set once and are then re-used for several patient datasets. However, the stability of the chosen parameters is not evaluated and a small change in the parameter values can give very different results. The user remains completely unaware of such effects. Furthermore, it is difficult to reproduce output results between different users. We propose a visualization tool that allows the user to visually explore how small variations in parameter values affect the output of fiber tracking. With this knowledge the user cannot only assess the stability of commonly used parameter values but also evaluate in a more reliable way the output results between different patients. Existing tools do not provide such information. A small user evaluation of our tool has been done to show the potential of the technique.
A hyperbox is a two-dimensional depiction of an N-dimensional box (rectangular parallelepiped). The authors define the visual syntax of hyperboxes, state some properties, and sketch two applications. Hyperboxes can be evocative visual names for tensors or multidimensional arrays in visual programming languages. They can also be used to simultaneously display all pairwise relationships in an N-dimensional dataset. This can be helpful in choosing a sequence of dimension-reducing transformations that preserve interesting properties of the dataset.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a way to visualize a flow field using Line Integral Convolution (LIC) with a multi frequency noise texture. A broad range of feature sizes can enhance a user's perception of the magnitudes and direction of the flow. In addition, the multiple scales of feature size help a user clarify the motion of the flow in an animation.
An eigenvector method for vortex identification has been applied to recent numerical and experimental studies in external flow aerodynamics. It is shown to be an effective way to extract and visualize features such as vortex cores, spiral vortex breakdowns, vortex bursting, and vortex diffusion. Several problems are reported and illustrated. These include: disjointed line segments, detecting non-vortical flow features, and vortex core displacement. Future research and applications are discussed, such as using vortex cores to guide automatic grid refinement.
Virtual angioscopy is a non invasive medical procedure for exploring parts of the human vascular system. We have developed an interactive tool that takes as input, data acquired with standard medical imaging modalities and regards it as a virtual environment to be interactively inspected. The system supports real time navigation with stereoscopic direct volume rendering and dynamic endoscopic camera control, interactive tissue classification, and interactive point picking for morphological feature measurement. We provide an overview of the system, discuss the techniques used in our prototype, and present experimental results on human data sets.
This paper describes a set of techniques developed for the visualization of high-resolution volume data generated from industrial computed tomography for nondestructive testing (NDT) applications. Because the data are typically noisy and contain fine features, direct volume rendering methods do not always give us satisfactory results. We have coupled region growing techniques and a 2D histogram interface to facilitate volumetric feature extraction. The new interface allows the user to conveniently identify, separate or composite, and compare features in the data. To lower the cost of segmentation, we show how partial region growing results can suggest a reasonably good classification function for the rendering of the whole volume. The NDT applications that we work on demand visualization tasks including not only feature extraction and visual inspection, but also modeling and measurement of concealed structures in volumetric objects. An efficient filtering and modeling process for generating surface representation of extracted features is also introduced. Four CT data sets for preliminary NDT are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new visualization strategy that we have developed.
Effective visualization of vector fields relies on the ability to control the size and density of the underlying mapping to visual cues used to represent the field. In this paper we introduce the use of a reaction-diffusion model, already well known for its ability to form irregular spatio-temporal patters, to control the size, density, and placement of the vector field representation. We demonstrate that it is possible to encode vector field information (orientation and magnitude) into the parameters governing a reaction-diffusion model to form a spot pattern with the correct orientation, size, and density, creating an effective visualization. To encode direction we texture the spots using a light to dark fading texture. We also show that it is possible to use the reaction-diffusion model to visualize an additional scalar value, such as the uncertainty in the orientation of the vector field. An additional benefit of the reaction-diffusion visualization technique arises from its automatic density distribution. This benefit suggests using the technique to augment other vector visualization techniques. We demonstrate this utility by augmenting a LIC visualization with a reaction-diffusion visualization. Finally, the reaction-diffusion visualization method provides a technique that can be used for streamline and glyph placement.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging method that can be used to measure local information about the structure of white matter within the human brain. Combining DTI data with the computational methods of MR tractography, neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used visualization techniques to better understand tractography data, but they often struggle with the abundance and complexity of the pathways. We describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box-shaped regions (or volumes of interest) to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. A simple and flexible query language allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. Queries can be further restricted by numerical path properties such as length, mean fractional anisotropy, and mean curvature. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers. We survey some questions that researchers have been asking about tractography data and show how our system can be used to answer these questions efficiently.
We present a new method for guiding virtual colonoscopic navigation and registration by using teniae coli as anatomical landmarks. As most existing protocols require a patient to be scanned in both supine and prone positions to increase sensitivity in detecting colonic polyps, reference and registration between scans are necessary. However, the conventional centerline approach, generating only the longitudinal distance along the colon, lacks the necessary orientation information to synchronize the virtual navigation cameras in both scanned positions. In this paper we describe a semi-automatic method to detect teniae coli from a colonic surface model reconstructed from CT colonography. Teniae coli are three bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the surface of the colon. They form a triple helix structure from the appendix to the sigmoid colon and are ideal references for virtual navigation. Our method was applied to 3 patients resulting in 6 data sets (supine and prone scans). The detected teniae coli matched well with our visual inspection. In addition, we demonstrate that polyps visible on both scans can be located and matched more efficiently with the aid of a teniae coli guided navigation implementation.
Understanding and analyzing complex volumetrically varying data is a difficult problem. Many computational visualization techniques have had only limited success in succinctly portraying the structure of three-dimensional turbulent flow. Motivated by both the extensive history and success of illustration and photographic flow visualization techniques, we have developed a new interactive volume rendering and visualization system for flows and volumes that simulates and enhances traditional illustration, experimental advection, and photographic flow visualization techniques. Our system uses a combination of varying focal and contextual illustrative styles, new advanced two-dimensional transfer functions, enhanced Schlieren and shadowgraphy shaders, and novel oriented structure enhancement techniques to allow interactive visualization, exploration, and comparative analysis of scalar, vector, and time-varying volume datasets. Both traditional illustration techniques and photographic flow visualization techniques effectively reduce visual clutter by using compact oriented structure information to convey three-dimensional structures. Therefore, a key to the effectiveness of our system is using one-dimensional (Schlieren and shadowgraphy) and two-dimensional (silhouette) oriented structural information to reduce visual clutter, while still providing enough three-dimensional structural information for the user's visual system to understand complex three-dimensional flow data. By combining these oriented feature visualization techniques with flexible transfer function controls, we can visualize scalar and vector data, allow comparative visualization of flow properties in a succinct, informative manner, and provide continuity for visualizing time-varying datasets.
Interactive steering with visualization has been a common goal of the visualization research community for twenty years, but it is rarely ever realized in practice. In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), it is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space - thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters - and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior. The excellent results which we achieved for the common rail injection system strongly suggest that our approach has a great potential of being generalized to other, similar scenarios.
Methods that faithfully and robustly capture the geometry of complex material interfaces in labeled volume data are important for generating realistic and accurate visualizations and simulations of real-world objects. The generation of such multimaterial models from measured data poses two unique challenges: first, the surfaces must be well-sampled with regular, efficient tessellations that are consistent across material boundaries; and second, the resulting meshes must respect the nonmanifold geometry of the multimaterial interfaces. This paper proposes a strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes using dynamic particle systems, including a novel, differentiable representation of the material junctions that allows the particle system to explicitly sample corners, edges, and surfaces of material intersections. The distributions of particles are controlled by fundamental sampling constraints, allowing Delaunay-based meshing algorithms to reliably extract watertight meshes of consistently high-quality.
In this work a new method for visualization of three-dimensional turbulent flow using particle motion animation is presented. The method is based on Reynolds decomposition of a turbulent flow field into a convective and a turbulent motion. At each step of particle path generation a stochastic perturbation is added, resulting in random-walk motions of particles. A physical relation is established between the perturbations and the eddy-diffusivity, which is calculated in a turbulent flow simulation. The flow data used is a mean velocity field, and an eddy-diffusivity field. The erratic particle motions are more than just a visual effect, but represent a real physical phenomenon. An implementation of the method is described, and an example of a turbulent channel flow is given, which clearly shows the random particle motions in their context of general fluid motion patterns.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
GPU-based raycasting offers an interesting alternative to conventional slice-based volume rendering due to the inherent flexibility and the high quality of the generated images. Recent advances in graphics hardware allow for the ray traversal and volume sampling to be executed on a per-fragment level completely on the GPU leading to interactive framerates. In this work we present optimization techniques that improve the performance and quality of GPU-based volume raycasting. We apply a hybrid image/object space approach to accelerate the ray traversal in animation sequences that works for both isosurface rendering and semi-transparent volume rendering. An empty-space-leaping technique that exploits the spatial coherence between consecutively rendered images is used to estimate the optimal initial ray sampling point for each image pixel. These can double the rendering performance for typical volumetric data sets without sacrificing image quality. The achieved speed-up allows for further improvements of image quality. We demonstrate an object space antialiasing technique based on selective super-sampling at sharp creases and silhouette edges which also benefits from exploiting frame-to-frame coherence.
With the growing size of captured 3D models it has become increasingly important to provide basic efficient processing methods for large unorganized raw surface-sample point data sets. In this paper we introduce a novel stream-based (and out-of-core) point processing framework. The proposed approach processes points in an orderly sequential way by sorting them and sweeping along a spatial dimension. The major advantages of this new concept are: (1) support of extensible and concatenate local operators called stream operators, (2) low main-memory usage and (3) applicability to process very large data sets out-of-core.
This paper presents an advanced evenly-spaced streamline placement algorithm for fast, high-quality, and robust layout of flow lines. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator with adaptive step size and error control is employed for rapid accurate streamline advection. Cubic Hermite polynomial interpolation with large sample-spacing is adopted to create fewer evenly-spaced samples along each streamline to reduce the amount of distance checking. We propose two methods to enhance placement quality. Double queues are used to prioritize topological seeding and to favor long streamlines to minimize discontinuities. Adaptive distance control based on the local flow variance is explored to reduce cavities. Furthermore, we propose a universal, effective, fast, and robust loop detection strategy to address closed and spiraling streamlines. Our algorithm is an order-of-magnitude faster than Jobard and Lefer's algorithm with better placement quality and over 5 times faster than Mebarki et al.'s algorithm with comparable placement quality, but with a more robust solution to loop detection
Diffusion tensor imaging is of high value in neurosurgery, providing information about the location of white matter tracts in the human brain. For their reconstruction, streamline techniques commonly referred to as fiber tracking model the underlying fiber structures and have therefore gained interest. To meet the requirements of surgical planning and to overcome the visual limitations of line representations, a new real-time visualization approach of high visual quality is introduced. For this purpose, textured triangle strips and point sprites are combined in a hybrid strategy employing GPU programming. The triangle strips follow the fiber streamlines and are textured to obtain a tube-like appearance. A vertex program is used to orient the triangle strips towards the camera. In order to avoid triangle flipping in case of fiber segments where the viewing and segment direction are parallel, a correct visual representation is achieved in these areas by chains of point sprites. As a result, high quality visualization similar to tubes is provided allowing for interactive multimodal inspection. Overall, the presented approach is faster than existing techniques of similar visualization quality and at the same time allows for real-time rendering of dense bundles encompassing a high number of fibers, which is of high importance for diagnosis and surgical planning
Topological methods give concise and expressive visual representations of flow fields. The present work suggests a comparable method for the visualization of human brain diffusion MRI data. We explore existing techniques for the topological analysis of generic tensor fields, but find them inappropriate for diffusion MRI data. Thus, we propose a novel approach that considers the asymptotic behavior of a probabilistic fiber tracking method and define analogs of the basic concepts of flow topology, like critical points, basins, and faces, with interpretations in terms of brain anatomy. The resulting features are fuzzy, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in any connectivity estimate from diffusion imaging. We describe an algorithm to extract the new type of features, demonstrate its robustness under noise, and present results for two regions in a diffusion MRI dataset to illustrate that the method allows a meaningful visual analysis of probabilistic fiber tracking results.
In this paper we present techniques for the visualization of unsteady flows using streak surfaces, which allow for the first time an adaptive integration and rendering of such surfaces in real-time. The techniques consist of two main components, which are both realized on the GPU to exploit computational and bandwidth capacities for numerical particle integration and to minimize bandwidth requirements in the rendering of the surface. In the construction stage, an adaptive surface representation is generated. Surface refinement and coarsening strategies are based on local surface properties like distortion and curvature. We compare two different methods to generate a streak surface: a) by computing a patch-based surface representation that avoids any interdependence between patches, and b) by computing a particle-based surface representation including particle connectivity, and by updating this connectivity during particle refinement and coarsening. In the rendering stage, the surface is either rendered as a set of quadrilateral surface patches using high-quality point-based approaches, or a surface triangulation is built in turn from the given particle connectivity and the resulting triangle mesh is rendered. We perform a comparative study of the proposed techniques with respect to surface quality, visual quality and performance by visualizing streak surfaces in real flows using different rendering options.
The author describes a visualization model for three-dimensional scalar data fields based on linear transport theory. The concept of virtual particles for the extraction of information from data fields in introduced. The role of different types of interaction of the data field with those particles such as absorption, scattering, source and color shift are discussed and demonstrated. Special attention is given to possible tools for the enhancement of interesting data features. Random texturing can provide visual insights as to the magnitude and distribution of deviations of related data fields, e.g., originating from analytic models, and measurements, or in the noise content of a given data field. Hidden symmetries of a data set can often be identified visually by allowing it to interact with a preselected beam of physical particles with the attendant appearance of characteristic structural effects such as channeling.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We approach the problem of exploring a virtual space by exploiting positional and camera-model constraints on navigation to provide extra assistance that focuses the user's explorational wanderings on the task objectives. Our specific design incorporates not only task-based constraints on the viewer's location, gaze, and viewing parameters, but also a personal "glide" that serves two important functions: keeping the user oriented in the navigation space, and "pointing" to interesting subject areas as they are approached. The guide's cues may be ignored by continuing in motion, but if the user stops, the gaze shifts automatically toward whatever the guide was interested in. This design has the serendipitous feature that it automatically incorporates a nested collaborative paradigm simply by allowing any given viewer to be seen as the "guide" of one or more viewers following behind; the leading automated guide (we tend to select a guide dog for this avatar) can remind the leading live human guide of interesting sites to point out, while each real human collaborator down the chain has some choices about whether to follow the local leader's hints. We have chosen VRML as our initial development medium primarily because of its portability, and we have implemented a variety of natural modes for leading and collaborating, including ways for collaborators to attach to and detach from a particular leader.
We present a novel approach to surface reconstruction based on the Delaunay complex. First we give a simple and fast algorithm that picks locally a surface at each vertex. For that, we introduce the concept of /spl lambda/-intervals. It turns out that for smooth regions of the surface this method works very well and at difficult parts of the surface yields an output well-suited for postprocessing. As a postprocessing step we propose a topological clean up and a new technique based on linear programming in order to establish a topologically correct surface. These techniques should be useful also for many other reconstruction schemes.
Within the field of computer graphics and visualization, it is often necessary to visualize polygonal models with large number of polygons. Display quality is mandatory, but it is also desirable to have the ability to rapidly update the display in order to facilitate interactive use. Point based rendering methods have been shown effective for this task. Building on this paradigm we introduce the PMR system which uses a hierarchy both in points and triangles for rendering. This hierarchy is fundamentally different from the ones used in existing methods. It is based on the feature geometry in the object space rather than its projection in the screen space. This provides certain advantages over the existing methods.
Tensors occur in many areas of science and engineering. Especially, they are used to describe charge, mass and energy transport (i.e. electrical conductivity tensor, diffusion tensor, thermal conduction tensor resp.) If the locale transport pattern is complicated, usual second order tensor representation is not sufficient. So far, there are no appropriate visualization methods for this case. We point out similarities of symmetric higher order tensors and spherical harmonics. A spherical harmonic representation is used to improve tensor glyphs. This paper unites the definition of streamlines and tensor lines and generalizes tensor lines to those applications where second order tensors representations fail. The algorithm is tested on the tractography problem in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and improved for this special application.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI-based technique for quantifying water diffusion in living tissue. In the white matter of the brain, water diffuses more rapidly along the neuronal axons than in the perpendicular direction. By exploiting this phenomenon, DTI can be used to determine trajectories of fiber bundles, or neuronal connections between regions, in the brain. The resulting bundles can be visualized. However, the resulting visualizations can be complex and difficult to interpret. An effective approach is to pre-determine trajectories from a large number of positions throughout the white matter (full brain fiber tracking) and to offer facilities to aid the user in selecting fiber bundles of interest. Two factors are crucial for the use and acceptance of this technique in clinical studies: firstly, the selection of the bundles by brain experts should be interactive, supported by real-time visualization of the trajectories registered with anatomical MRI scans. Secondly, the fiber selections should be reproducible, so that different experts will achieve the same results. In this paper we present a practical technique for the interactive selection of fiber-bundles using multiple convex objects that is an order of magnitude faster than similar techniques published earlier. We also present the results of a clinical study with ten subjects that show that our selection approach is highly reproducible for fractional anisotropy (FA) calculated over the selected fiber bundles.
Our ability to generate ever-larger, increasingly-complex data, has established the need for scalable methods that identify, and provide insight into, important variable trends and interactions. Query-driven methods are among the small subset of techniques that are able to address both large and highly complex datasets. This paper presents a new method that increases the utility of query-driven techniques by visually conveying statistical information about the trends that exist between variables in a query. In this method, correlation fields, created between pairs of variables, are used with the cumulative distribution functions of variables expressed in a users query. This integrated use of cumulative distribution functions and correlation fields visually reveals, with respect to the solution space of the query, statistically important interactions between any three variables, and allows for trends between these variables to be readily identified. We demonstrate our method by analyzing interactions between variables in two flame-front simulations.
We present a novel approach for analyzing two-dimensional (2D) flow field data based on the idea of invariant moments. Moment invariants have traditionally been used in computer vision applications, and we have adapted them for the purpose of interactive exploration of flow field data. The new class of moment invariants we have developed allows us to extract and visualize 2D flow patterns, invariant under translation, scaling, and rotation. With our approach one can study arbitrary flow patterns by searching a given 2D flow data set for any type of pattern as specified by a user. Further, our approach supports the computation of moments at multiple scales, facilitating fast pattern extraction and recognition. This can be done for critical point classification, but also for patterns with greater complexity. This multi-scale moment representation is also valuable for the comparative visualization of flow field data. The specific novel contributions of the work presented are the mathematical derivation of the new class of moment invariants, their analysis regarding critical point features, the efficient computation of a novel feature space representation, and based upon this the development of a fast pattern recognition algorithm for complex flow structures.
Stream surfaces are an intuitive approach to represent 3D vector fields. In many cases, however, they are challenging objects to visualize and to understand, due to a high degree of self-occlusion. Despite the need for adequate rendering methods, little work has been done so far in this important research area. In this paper, we present an illustrative rendering strategy for stream surfaces. In our approach, we apply various rendering techniques, which are inspired by the traditional flow illustrations drawn by Dallmann and Abraham &amp; Shaw in the early 1980s. Among these techniques are contour lines and halftoning to show the overall surface shape. Flow direction as well as singularities on the stream surface are depicted by illustrative surface streamlines. ;To go beyond reproducing static text book images, we provide several interaction features, such as movable cuts and slabs allowing an interactive exploration of the flow and insights into subjacent structures, e.g., the inner windings of vortex breakdown bubbles. These methods take only the parameterized stream surface as input, require no further preprocessing, and can be freely combined by the user. We explain the design, GPU-implementation, and combination of the different illustrative rendering and interaction methods and demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to stream surfaces from various flow simulations.
VizWiz is a Java applet that provides basic interactive scientific visualization functionality, such as isosurfaces, cutting planes, and elevation plots, for 2D and 3D datasets that can be loaded into the applet by the user via, the applet's Web server. VizWiz is unique in that it is a completely platform independent scientific visualization tool, and is usable over the Web, without being manually downloaded or installed. Its 3D graphics are implemented using only the Java AWT API, making them portable across all Java supporting platforms. The paper describes the implementation of VizWiz, including design tradeoffs. Graphics performance figures are provided for a number of different platforms. A solution to the problem of uploading user data files into a Java applet, working around security limitations, is demonstrated. The lessons learned from this project are discussed.
This paper addresses the problem of surface reconstruction of highly noisy point clouds. The surfaces to be reconstructed are assumed to be 2-manifolds of piecewise C/sup 1/ continuity, with isolated small irregular regions of high curvature, sophisticated local topology or abrupt burst of noise. At each sample point, a quadric field is locally fitted via a modified moving least squares method. These locally fitted quadric fields are then blended together to produce a pseudo-signed distance field using Shepard's method. We introduce a prioritized front growing scheme in the process of local quadrics fitting. Flatter surface areas tend to grow faster. The already fitted regions will subsequently guide the fitting of those irregular regions in their neighborhood.
We present a fast, topology-preserving approach for isosurface simplification. The underlying concept behind our approach is to preserve the disconnected surface components in cells during isosurface simplification. We represent isosurface components in a novel representation, called enhanced cell, where each surface component in a cell is represented by a vertex and its connectivity information. A topology-preserving vertex clustering algorithm is applied to build a vertex octree. An enhanced dual contouring algorithm is applied to extract error-bounded multiresolution isosurfaces from the vertex octree while preserving the finest resolution isosurface topology. Cells containing multiple vertices are properly handled during contouring. Our approach demonstrates better results than existing octree-based simplification techniques.
Topological methods aim at the segmentation of a vector field into areas of different flow behavior. For 2D time-dependent vector fields, two such segmentations are possible: either concerning the behavior of stream lines, or of path lines. While stream line oriented topology is well established, we introduce path line oriented topology as a new visualization approach in this paper. As a contribution to stream line oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations. To get the path line oriented topology we segment the vector field into areas of attracting, repelling and saddle-like behavior of the path lines. We compare both kinds of topologies and apply them to a number of data sets.
Multiple spatially-related videos are increasingly used in security, communication, and other applications. Since it can be difficult to understand the spatial relationships between multiple videos in complex environments (e.g. to predict a person's path through a building), some visualization techniques, such as video texture projection, have been used to aid spatial understanding. In this paper, we identify and begin to characterize an overall class of visualization techniques that combine video with 3D spatial context. This set of techniques, which we call contextualized videos, forms a design palette which must be well understood so that designers can select and use appropriate techniques that address the requirements of particular spatial video tasks. In this paper, we first identify user tasks in video surveillance that are likely to benefit from contextualized videos and discuss the video, model, and navigation related dimensions of the contextualized video design space. We then describe our contextualized video testbed which allows us to explore this design space and compose various video visualizations for evaluation. Finally, we describe the results of our process to identify promising design patterns through user selection of visualization features from the design space, followed by user interviews.
Neurobiology investigates how anatomical and physiological relationships in the nervous system mediate behavior. Molecular genetic techniques, applied to species such as the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, have proven to be an important tool in this research. Large databases of transgenic specimens are being built and need to be analyzed to establish models of neural information processing. In this paper we present an approach for the exploration and analysis of neural circuits based on such a database. We have designed and implemented \emph{BrainGazer}, a system which integrates visualization techniques for volume data acquired through confocal microscopy as well as annotated anatomical structures with an intuitive approach for accessing the available information. We focus on the ability to visually query the data based on semantic as well as spatial relationships. Additionally, we present visualization techniques for the concurrent depiction of neurobiological volume data and geometric objects which aim to reduce visual clutter. The described system is the result of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration between neurobiologists and visualization researchers.
In this paper we present a novel focus+context zooming technique, which allows users to zoom into a route and its associated landmarks in a 3D urban environment from a 45-degree bird's-eye view. Through the creative utilization of the empty space in an urban environment, our technique can informatively reveal the focus region and minimize distortions to the context buildings. We first create more empty space in the 2D map by broadening the road with an adapted seam carving algorithm. A grid-based zooming technique is then used to enlarge the landmarks to reclaim the created empty space and thus reduce distortions to the other parts. Finally,an occlusion-free route visualization scheme adaptively scales the buildings occluding the route to make the route always visible to users. Our method can be conveniently integrated into Google Earth and Virtual Earth to provide seamless route zooming and help users better explore a city and plan their tours. It can also be used in other applications such as information overlay to a virtual city.
Flow volumes are extended for use in unsteady (time-dependent) flows. The resulting unsteady flow volumes are the 3D analogs of streaklines. There are few examples where methods other than particle tracing have been used to visualize time-varying flows. Since particle paths can become convoluted in time, there are additional considerations to be made when extending any visualization technique to unsteady flows. We present some solutions to the problems which occur in subdivision, rendering and system design. We apply the unsteady flow volumes to a variety of field types, including moving multi-zoned curvilinear grids.
The work presents interactive flow visualization techniques specifically adapted for PowerFLOW/sup TM/, a lattice based CFD code from the EXA corporation. Their Digital Physics/sup TM/ fluid simulation technique is performed on a hierarchy of locally refined cartesian grids with a fine voxel resolution in areas of interesting flow features. Among other applications, the PowerFLOW solver is used for aerodynamic simulations in car body development where the advantages of automatic grid generation from CAD models is of great interest. In a joint project with BMW and EXA, we are developing a visualization tool which incorporates virtual reality techniques for the interactive exploration of the large scalar and vector data sets. We describe the specific data structures and interpolation techniques and we report on fast particle tracing, taking into account collisions with the car body geometry. An OpenGL Optimizer based implementation allows for the inspection of the flow with particle probes and slice probes at interactive frame rates.
Visualization is essential for understanding the increasing volumes of digital data. However, the process required to create insightful visualizations is involved and time consuming. Although several visualization tools are available, including tools with sophisticated visual interfaces, they are out of reach for users who have little or no knowledge of visualization techniques and/or who do not have programming expertise. In this paper, we propose VisMashup, a new framework for streamlining the creation of customized visualization applications. Because these applications can be customized for very specific tasks, they can hide much of the complexity in a visualization specification and make it easier for users to explore visualizations by manipulating a small set of parameters. We describe the framework and how it supports the various tasks a designer needs to carry out to develop an application, from mining and exploring a set of visualization specifications (pipelines), to the creation of simplified views of the pipelines, and the automatic generation of the application and its interface. We also describe the implementation of the system and demonstrate its use in two real application scenarios.
A fundamental challenge for time-varying volume data analysis and visualization is the lack of capability to observe and track data change or evolution in an occlusion-free, controllable, and adaptive fashion. In this paper, we propose to organize a timevarying data set into a hierarchy of states. By deriving transition probabilities among states, we construct a global map that captures the essential transition relationships in the time-varying data. We introduce the TransGraph, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The TransGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking. The user interacts with the TransGraph and makes connection to the volumetric data through brushing and linking. A set of intuitive queries is provided to enable knowledge extraction from time-varying data. We test our approach with time-varying data sets of different characteristics and the results show that the TransGraph can effectively augment our ability in understanding time-varying data.
Techniques for displaying 3D isovalues of scalar fields such as stress within a solid finite-element model generally involve examining each element for values of interest. An inexpensive, straightforward method is discussed for reducing the number of elements searched for such isovalues. It takes advantage of one traversal of the element data to yield a compact classification of the model by result values and ranges, with no sorting required. This data structure can then relate any scalar isovalue to a set of element groups which are closely inclusive of the isovalue. This method is intended for applications requiring repeated access to the analysis data, such as animation and interactive rendering of isosurfaces and scalar fields. While applicable to general volume visualization problems, it is particularly well suited to optimizing real-valued continuum field results such as those found in finite-element data.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Methods are presented for the visualization of fuzzy data based on the sensitivity of the human visual system to motion and dynamic changes, and the ease of which electronic display devices can change their display. The methods include taking an otherwise static image and displaying in an animation loop either its segmented components or a series of blurred versions of the whole image. This approach was applied to sea-surface temperature data and was found to be effective in showing fuzzy details embedded in the data, and in drawing the viewer's attention. This approach and these methods could play a significant role in the display of browse products for massive data and information systems.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volume navigation is the interactive exploration of volume data sets by "flying" the view point through the data, producing a volume rendered view at each frame. The authors present an inexpensive perspective volume navigation method designed to run on a PC platform with accelerated 3D graphics hardware. They compute perspective projections at each frame, allow trilinear interpolation of sample points, and render both gray scale and RGB volumes by volumetric compositing. The implementation handles arbitrarily large volumes, by dynamically swapping data within the local depth-limited frustum into main memory as the viewpoint moves through the volume. They describe a new ray casting algorithm that takes advantage of the coherence inherent in adjacent frames to generate a sequence of approximate animated frames much faster than they could be computed individually. They also take advantage of the 3D graphics acceleration hardware to offload much of the alpha blending and resampling from the CPU.
We present collaborative scientific visualization in STUDIERSTUBE. STUDIERSTUBE is an augmented reality system that has several advantages over conventional desktop and other virtual reality environments, including true stereoscopy, 3D-interaction, individual viewpoints and customized views for multiple users, unhindered natural collaboration and low cost. We demonstrate the application of this concept for the interaction of multiple users and illustrate it with several visualizations of dynamical systems in DynSys3D, a visualization system running on top of AVS.
Presents results from a user study that compared six visualization methods for 2D vector data. Two methods used different distributions of short arrows, two used different distributions of integral curves, one used wedges located to suggest flow lines, and the final one was line-integral convolution (LIC). We defined three simple but representative tasks for users to perform using visualizations from each method: (1) locating all critical points in an image, (2) identifying critical point types, and (3) advecting a particle. The results show different strengths and weaknesses for each method. We found that users performed better with methods that: (1) showed the sign of vectors within the vector field, (2) visually represented integral curves, and (3) visually represented the locations of critical points. These results provide quantitative support for some of the anecdotal evidence concerning visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also provide a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods and for defining additional tasks to further understand tradeoffs among methods. They may also be useful for evaluating 2D vectors on 2D surfaces embedded in 3D and for defining analogous tasks for 3D visualization methods.
Maps of biophysical and geophysical variables using Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite image data are an important component of Earth science. These maps have a single value derived at every grid cell and standard techniques are used to visualize them. Current tools fall short, however, when it is necessary to describe a distribution of values at each grid cell. Distributions may represent a frequency of occurrence over time, frequency of occurrence from multiple runs of an ensemble forecast or possible values from an uncertainty model. We identify these "distribution data sets" and present a case study to visualize such 2D distributions. Distribution data sets are different from multivariate data sets in the sense that the values are for a single variable instead of multiple variables. Data for this case study consists of multiple realizations of percent forest cover, generated using a geostatistical technique that combines ground measurements and satellite imagery to model uncertainty about forest cover. We present two general approaches for analyzing and visualizing such data sets. The first is a pixel-wise analysis of the probability density functions for the 2D image while the second is an analysis of features identified within the image. Such pixel-wise and feature-wise views will give Earth scientists a more complete understanding of distribution data sets. See www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/avis/nasa is for additional information.
Efficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties is an important topic with many applications in science and engineering. Examples include environmental pollution borderline identification, identification of the limits of an oil basin, or discrimination between contaminated and healthy tissue in medicine. This paper presents an approach for such visualization using points as display primitives. The approach is to render each polygon as a collection of points and to displace each point from the surface in the direction of the surface normal by an amount proportional to some random number multiplied by the uncertainty level at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudo-coloring and shading to give rise to efficient and revealing visualizations. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries.
In this paper we present an interactive texture-based technique for visualizing three-dimensional vector fields. The goal of the algorithm is to provide a general volume rendering framework allowing the user to compute three-dimensional flow textures interactively, and to modify the appearance of the visualization on the fly. To achieve our goal, we decouple the visualization pipeline into two disjoint stages. First, streamlines are generated from the 3D vector data. Various geometric properties of the streamlines are extracted and converted into a volumetric form using a hardware-assisted slice sweeping algorithm. In the second phase of the algorithm, the attributes stored in the volume are used as texture coordinates to look up an appearance texture to generate both informative and aesthetic representations of the underlying vector field. Users can change the input textures and instantaneously visualize the rendering results. With our algorithm, visualizations with enhanced structural perception using various visual cues can be rendered in real time. A myriad of existing geometry-based and texture-based visualization techniques can also be emulated.
Real-time rendering of massively textured 3D scenes usually involves two major problems: Large numbers of texture switches are a well-known performance bottleneck and the set of simultaneously visible textures is limited by the graphics memory. This paper presents a level-of-detail texturing technique that overcomes both problems. In a preprocessing step, the technique creates a hierarchical data structure for all textures used by scene objects, and it derives texture atlases at different resolutions. At runtime, our texturing technique requires only a small set of these texture atlases, which represent scene textures in an appropriate size depending on the current camera position and screen resolution. Independent of the number and total size of all simultaneously visible textures, the achieved frame rates are similar to that of rendering the scene without any texture switches. Since the approach includes dynamic texture loading, the total size of the textures is only limited by the hard disk capacity. The technique is applicable for any 3D scenes whose scene objects are primarily distributed in a plane, such as in the case of 3D city models or outdoor scenes in computer games. Our approach has been successfully applied to massively textured, large-scale 3D city models.
Video visualization is a computation process that extracts meaningful information from original video data sets and conveys the extracted information to users in appropriate visual representations. This paper presents a broad treatment of the subject, following a typical research pipeline involving concept formulation, system development, a path-finding user study, and a field trial with real application data. In particular, we have conducted a fundamental study on the visualization of motion events in videos. We have, for the first time, deployed flow visualization techniques in video visualization. We have compared the effectiveness of different abstract visual representations of videos. We have conducted a user study to examine whether users are able to learn to recognize visual signatures of motions, and to assist in the evaluation of different visualization techniques. We have applied our understanding and the developed techniques to a set of application video clips. Our study has demonstrated that video visualization is both technically feasible and cost-effective. It has provided the first set of evidence confirming that ordinary users can be accustomed to the visual features depicted in video visualizations, and can learn to recognize visual signatures of a variety of motion events
Analyzing, visualizing, and illustrating changes within time-varying volumetric data is challenging due to the dynamic changes occurring between timesteps. The changes and variations in computational fluid dynamic volumes and atmospheric 3D datasets do not follow any particular transformation. Features within the data move at different speeds and directions making the tracking and visualization of these features a difficult task. We introduce a texture-based feature tracking technique to overcome some of the current limitations found in the illustration and visualization of dynamic changes within time-varying volumetric data. Our texture-based technique tracks various features individually and then uses the tracked objects to better visualize structural changes. We show the effectiveness of our texture-based tracking technique with both synthetic and real world time-varying data. Furthermore, we highlight the specific visualization, annotation, registration, and feature isolation benefits of our technique. For instance, we show how our texture-based tracking can lead to insightful visualizations of time-varying data. Such visualizations, more than traditional visualization techniques, can assist domain scientists to explore and understand dynamic changes.
Recent results have shown a link between geometric properties of isosurfaces and statistical properties of the underlying sampled data. However, this has two defects: not all of the properties described converge to the same solution, and the statistics computed are not always invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations. We apply Federer's Coarea Formula from geometric measure theory to explain these discrepancies. We describe an improved substitute for histograms based on weighting with the inverse gradient magnitude, develop a statistical model that is invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations, and argue that this provides a consistent method for algorithm evaluation across multiple datasets based on histogram equalization. We use our corrected formulation to reevaluate recent results on average isosurface complexity, and show evidence that noise is one cause of the discrepancy between the expected figure and the observed one.
Data sets resulting from physical simulations typically contain a multitude of physical variables. It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data. Our driving applications are smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, where each particle carries multiple properties. The data sets are given in the form of unstructured point-based volume data. We directly extract our surfaces from such data without prior resampling or grid generation. The surface extraction computes individual points on the surface, which is supported by an efficient neighborhood computation. The extracted surface points are rendered using point-based rendering operations. Our approach combines methods in scientific visualization for object-space operations with methods in information visualization for feature-space operations.
In this paper, we present the first algorithm to geometrically register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner (i.e. wallpapered) on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. Further, it can also tolerate large non-linear geometric distortions in the projectors as is common when mounting short throw lenses to allow a compact set-up. Our registration achieves sub-pixel accuracy on a large number of different vertically extruded surfaces and the image correction to achieve this registration can be run in real time on the GPU. This simple markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment, training and simulation applications.
Visual analysis is widely used to study the behavior of molecules. Of particular interest are the analysis of molecular interactions and the investigation of binding sites. For large molecules, however, it is difficult to detect possible binding sites and paths leading to these sites by pure visual inspection. In this paper, we present new methods for the computation and visualization of potential molecular paths. Using a novel filtering method, we extract the significant paths from the Voronoi diagram of spheres. For the interactive visualization of molecules and their paths, we present several methods using deferred shading and other state-of-theart techniques. To allow for a fast overview of reachable regions of the molecule, we illuminate the molecular surface using a large number of light sources placed on the extracted paths. We also provide a method to compute the extension surface of selected paths and visualize it using the skin surface. Furthermore, we use the extension surface to clip the molecule to allow easy visual tracking of even deeply buried paths. The methods are applied to several proteins to demonstrate their usefulness.
The authors present techniques for automating the illustration of geometric models based on traditional hand illustration methods. A system based on the techniques of traditional illustrators for automatically generating illustrations of complex three-dimensional models is described. The system relies on a richer set of display primitives, which are also outlined. Algorithmic details for emphasizing significant model components are discussed, and some preliminary results are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Vortex breakdowns and flow recirculation are essential phenomena in aeronautics where they appear as a limiting factor in the design of modern aircrafts. Because of the inherent intricacy of these features, standard flow visualization techniques typically yield cluttered depictions. The paper addresses the challenges raised by the visual exploration and validation of two CFD simulations involving vortex breakdown. To permit accurate and insightful visualization we propose a new approach that unfolds the geometry of the breakdown region by letting a plane travel through the structure along a curve. We track the continuous evolution of the associated projected vector field using the theoretical framework of parametric topology. To improve the understanding of the spatial relationship between the resulting curves and lines we use direct volume rendering and multidimensional transfer functions for the display of flow-derived scalar quantities. This enriches the visualization and provides an intuitive context for the extracted topological information. Our results offer clear, synthetic depictions that permit new insight into the structural properties of vortex breakdowns.
The need to examine and manipulate large surface models is commonly found in many science, engineering, and medical applications. On a desktop monitor, however, seeing the whole model in detail is not possible. In this paper, we present a new, interactive Focus+Context method for visualizing large surface models. Our method, based on an energy optimization model, allows the user to magnify an area of interest to see it in detail while deforming the rest of the area without perceivable distortion. The rest of the surface area is essentially shrunk to use as little of the screen space as possible in order to keep the entire model displayed on screen. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method with a variety of models.
Interactivity is key to exploration of volume data. Interactivity may be hindered due to many factors, e.g. large data size,high resolution or complexity of a data set, or an expensive rendering algorithm. We present a novel framework for visualizing volumedata that enables interactive exploration using proxy images, without accessing the original 3D data. Data exploration using directvolume rendering requires multiple (often redundant) accesses to possibly large amounts of data. The notion of visualization by proxyrelies on the ability to defer operations traditionally used for exploring 3D data to a more suitable intermediate representation forinteraction - proxy images. Such operations include view changes, transfer function exploration, and relighting. While previous workhas addressed specific interaction needs, we provide a complete solution that enables real-time interaction with large data sets andhas low hardware and storage requirements.
Methods for displaying scientific data using textures and raster operations rather than geometric techniques are described. The flexibility and simplicity of raster operations allow a greater choice of visualization techniques with only a small set of basic operations. In addition, texture mapping techniques that allow the representation of several variables simultaneously, without a high degree of clutter, are shown. The combination of traditional geometric techniques, image composition techniques, and image rendering techniques can be integrated into a single framework for the display of scientific data. A system for generating and operating on textures and images for the purposes of scientific visualization is presented. To illustrate its advantage, the development of bump maps for vector filters and contour lines is demonstrated.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Spot noise and line integral convolution (LIC) are two texture synthesis techniques for vector field visualization. The two techniques are compared. Continuous directional convolution is used as a common basis for comparing the techniques. It is shown that the techniques are based on the same mathematical concept. Comparisons of the visual appearance of the output and performance of the algorithms are made.
We present a technique for optimizing the rendering of high-depth complexity scenes. Prioritized-Layered Projection (PLP) does this by rendering an estimation of the visible set. The novelty in our work lies in the fact that we do not explicitly compute visible sets. Instead, our work is based on computing on demand a priority order for the polygons that maximizes the likelihood of rendering visible polygons before occluded ones for any given scene. Given a fixed budget, e.g. time or number of triangles, our rendering algorithm makes sure to render geometry, respecting the computed priority. There are two main steps to our technique: (1) an occupancy based tessellation of space; and (2) a solidity based traversal algorithm. PLP works by computing an occupancy based tessellation of space, which tends to have smaller cells where there are more geometric primitives, e.g., polygons. In this spatial tessellation, each cell is assigned a solidity value, which is directly proportional to its likelihood of occluding other cells. In its simplest form, a cell's solidity value is directly proportional to the number of polygons contained within it. During our traversal algorithm, cells are marked for projection, and the geometric primitives contained within them actually rendered. The traversal algorithm makes use of the cells' solidity, and other view-dependent information to determine the ordering in which to project cells. By tailoring the traversal algorithm to the occupancy based tessellation, we can achieve very good frame rates with low preprocessing and rendering costs. We describe our technique and its implementation in detail. We also provide experimental evidence of its performance and briefly discuss extensions of our algorithm.
This paper presents several distinguishing design features of RTVR-a Java-based library for real-time volume rendering. We describe, how the careful design of data structures, which in our case are based on voxel enumeration, and an intelligent use of lookup tables enable interactive volume rendering even on low-end PC hardware. By assigning voxels to distinct objects within the volume and by using an individual setup and combination of look-up tables for each object, object-aware rendering is performed: different transfer functions, shading models, and also compositing modes can be mixed within a single scene to depict each object in the most appropriate way, while still providing rendering results in real-time. While providing frame rates similar to volume visualization using 3D consumer hardware, the approach utilized by RTVR offers much more flexibility and extensibility due to its pure software nature. Furthermore, due to the memory-efficiency of the data representation and the implementation in Java, RTVR can be used to provide volume viewing facilities over low-bandwidth networks, with almost full control over rendering and visualization mapping parameters (clipping, shading, compositing, transfer function) for the user. This paper also addresses specific problems which arise by the use of Java for interactive visualization.
Subdivision surfaces are an attractive representation when modeling arbitrary-topology free-form surfaces and show great promise for applications in engineering design and computer animation. Interference detection is a critical tool in many of these applications. In this paper, we derive normal bounds for subdivision surfaces and use these to develop an efficient algorithm for (self-) interference detection.
We introduce a method for the animation of fire propagation and the burning consumption of objects represented as volumetric data sets. Our method uses a volumetric fire propagation model based on an enhanced distance field. It can simulate the spreading of multiple fire fronts over a specified isosurface without actually having to create that isosurface. The distance field is generated from a specific shell volume that rapidly creates narrow spatial bands around the virtual surface of any given isovalue. The complete distance field is then obtained by propagation from the initial bands. At each step multiple fire fronts can evolve simultaneously on the volumetric object. The flames of the fire are constructed from streams of particles whose movement is regulated by a velocity field generated with the hardware-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM). The LBM provides a physically-based simulation of the air flow around the burning object. The object voxels and the splats associated with the flame particles are rendered in the same pipeline so that the volume data with its external and internal structures can be displayed along with the fire.
We present build-by-number, a technique for quickly designing architectural structures that can be rendered photorealistically at interactive rates. We combine image-based capturing and rendering with procedural modeling techniques to allow the creation of novel structures in the style of real-world structures. Starting with a simple model recovered from a sparse image set, the model is divided into feature regions, such as doorways, windows, and brick. These feature regions essentially comprise a mapping from model space to image space, and can be recombined to texture a novel model. Procedural rules for the growth and reorganization of the model are automatically derived to allow for very fast editing and design. Further, the redundancies marked by the feature labeling can be used to perform automatic occlusion replacement and color equalization in the finished scene, which is rendered using view-dependent texture mapping on standard graphics hardware. Results using four captured scenes show that a great variety of novel structures can be created very quickly once a captured scene is available, and rendered with a degree of realism comparable to the original scene.
In multiresolution volume visualization, a visual representation of level-of-detail (LOD) quality is important for us to examine, compare, and validate different LOD selection algorithms. While traditional methods rely on ultimate images for quality measurement, we introduce the LOD map - an alternative representation of LOD quality and a visual interface for navigating multiresolution data exploration. Our measure for LOD quality is based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the distortion and contribution of multiresolution data blocks. A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features. It also allows us to compare different views and perform rendering budget control. A set of interactive techniques is proposed to make the LOD adjustment a simple and easy task. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on large scientific and medical data sets
The authors describe the real-time acoustic display capabilities developed for the virtual environment workstation (VIEW) project. The acoustic display is capable of generating localized acoustic cues in real time over headphones. An auditor symbology, a related collection of representational auditory objects or icons, can be designed using the auditory cue editor, which links both discrete and continuously varying acoustic parameters with information or events in the display. During a given display scenario, the symbology can be dynamically coordinated in real time with three-dimensional visual objects, speech, and gestural displays. The types of displays feasible with the system range from simple warnings and alarms to the acoustic representation of multidimensional data or events.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Meaningful scientific visualizations benefit the interpretation of scientific data, concepts and processes. To ensure meaningful visualizations, the visualization system needs to adapt to desires, disabilities and abilities of the user, interpretation aim, resources (hardware, software) available, and the form and content of the data to be visualized. We suggest describing these characteristics with four models: user model, problem domain/task model, resource model and data model. The paper makes suggestions for the generation of a user model as a basis for an adaptive visualization system. We propose to extract information about the user by involving the user in interactive computer tests and games. Relevant abilities tested are color perception, color memory, color ranking, mental rotation, and fine motor coordination.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper presents an algorithm combining view-dependent rendering and conservative occlusion culling for interactive display of complex environments. A vertex hierarchy of the entire scene is decomposed into a cluster hierarchy through a novel clustering and partitioning algorithm. The cluster hierarchy is then used for view-frustum and occlusion culling. Using hardware accelerated occlusion queries and frame-to-frame coherence, a potentially visible set of clusters is computed. An active vertex front and face list is computed from the visible clusters and rendered using vertex arrays. The integrated algorithm has been implemented on a Pentium IV PC with a NVIDIA GeForce 4 graphics card and applied in two complex environments composed of millions of triangles. The resulting system can render these environments at interactive rates with little loss in image quality and minimal popping artifacts.
A new method for the simplification and the visualization of vector fields is presented based on the notion of centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT's). A CVT is a special Voronoi tessellation for which the generators of the Voronoi regions in the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) with respect to a prescribed density. A distance function in both the spatial and vector spaces is introduced to measure the similarity of the spatially distributed vector fields. Based on such a distance, vector fields are naturally clustered and their simplified representations are obtained. Our method combines simple geometric intuitions with the rigorously established optimality properties of the CVTs. It is simple to describe, easy to understand and implement. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the CVT-based vector simplification and visualization methodology.
We propose a novel point-based approach to view dependent isosurface extraction. We introduce a fast visibility query system for the view dependent traversal, which exhibits moderate memory requirements. This technique allows for an interactive interrogation of the full visible woman dataset (1GB) at four to fifteen frames per second on a desktop computer. The point-based approach is built on an extraction scheme that classifies different sections of the isosurface into four categories, depending on the size of the geometry when projected onto the screen. In particular, we use points to represent small and subpixel triangles, as well as larger sections of the isosurface whose projection has subpixel size. To assign consistent and robust normals to individual points representing such regions, we propose to compute them during post processing of the extracted isosurface and provide the corresponding hardware implementation.
In this paper we introduce GPU particle tracing for the visualization of 3D diffusion tensor fields. For about half a million particles, reconstruction of diffusion directions from the tensor field, time integration and rendering can be done at interactive rates. Different visualization options like oriented particles of diffusion-dependent shape, stream lines or stream tubes facilitate the use of particle tracing for diffusion tensor visualization. The proposed methods provide efficient and intuitive means to show the dynamics in diffusion tensor fields, and they accommodate the exploration of the diffusion properties of biological tissue.
We describe a new progressive technique that allows real-time rendering of extremely large tetrahedral meshes. Our approach uses a client-server architecture to incrementally stream portions of the mesh from a server to a client which refines the quality of the approximate rendering until it converges to a full quality rendering. The results of previous steps are re-used in each subsequent refinement, thus leading to an efficient rendering. Our novel approach keeps very little geometry on the client and works by refining a set of rendered images at each step. Our interactive representation of the dataset is efficient, light-weight, and high quality. We present a framework for the exploration of large datasets stored on a remote server with a thin client that is capable of rendering and managing full quality volume visualizations
We present novel, comprehensive visualization techniques for the diagnosis of patients with coronary artery disease using segmented cardiac MRI data. We extent an accepted medical visualization technique called the bull's eye plot by removing discontinuities, preserving the volumetric nature of the left ventricular wall and adding anatomical context. The resulting volumetric bull's eye plot can be used for the assessment of transmurality. We link these visualizations to a 3D view that presents viability information in a detailed anatomical context. We combine multiple MRI scans (whole heart anatomical data, late enhancement data) and multiple segmentations (polygonal heart model, late enhancement contours, coronary artery tree). By selectively combining different rendering techniques we obtain comprehensive yet intuitive visualizations of the various data sources.
Medical imaging plays a central role in a vast range of healthcare practices. The usefulness of 3D visualizations has been demonstrated for many types of treatment planning. Nevertheless, full access to 3D renderings outside of the radiology department is still scarce even for many image-centric specialties. Our work stems from the hypothesis that this under-utilization is partly due to existing visualization systems not taking the prerequisites of this application domain fully into account. We have developed a medical visualization table intended to better fit the clinical reality. The overall design goals were two-fold: similarity to a real physical situation and a very low learning threshold. This paper describes the development of the visualization table with focus on key design decisions. The developed features include two novel interaction components for touch tables. A user study including five orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that the system is appropriate and useful for this application domain.
An exploratory effort to classify visual representations into homogeneous clusters is discussed. The authors collected hierarchical sorting data from twelve subjects. Five principal groups of visual representations emerged from a cluster analysis of sorting data: graphs and tables, maps, diagrams, networks, and icons. Two dimensions appear to distinguish these clusters: the amount of spatial information and cognitive processing effort. The authors discuss visual information processing issues relevant to the research, methodology and data analyses used to develop the classification system, results of the empirical study, and possible directions for future research.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An important issue in scientific visualization systems is the management of data sets. Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases. Finally the reconstructed data is visualized using various algorithms and the results are demonstrated.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper presents a parallel ray-casting volume rendering algorithm and its implementation on the massively parallel IBM SP-1 computer using the Chameleon message passing library. Though this algorithm takes advantage of many of the unique features of the SP-1 (e.g. high-speed switch, large memory per node, high-speed disk array, HIPPI display, et al.), the use of Chameleon allows the code to be executed on any collection of workstations. The algorithm is image-ordered and distributes the data and the computational load to individual processors. After the volume data is distributed, all processors then perform local ray tracing of their respective subvolumes concurrently. No interprocess communication takes place during the ray tracing process. After a subimage is generated by each processor, the final image is obtained by composing subimages between all the processors. The program itself is implemented as an interactive process through a GUI residing on a graphics workstation which is coupled to the parallel rendering algorithm via sockets. The paper highlights the Chameleon implementation, the GUI, some optimization improvements, static load balancing, and direct parallel display to a HIPPI framebuffer.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The World-Wide-Web (WWW) has created a new paradigm for online information retrieval by providing immediate and ubiquitous access to digital information of any type from data repositories located throughout the world. The web's development enables not only effective access for the generic user but also more efficient and timely information exchange among scientists and researchers. We have extended the capabilities of the web to include access to three-dimensional volume data sets with integrated control of a distributed client-server volume visualization system. This paper provides a brief background on the World-Wide-Web, an overview of the extensions necessary to support these new data types and a description of an implementation of this approach in a WWW-compliant distributed visualization system.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A software architecture is presented to integrate a database management system with data visualization. One of its primary objectives, the retention of user-data interactions, is detailed. By storing all queries over the data along with high-level descriptions of the query results and the associated visualization, the processes by which a database is explored can be analyzed. This approach can lead to important contributions in the development of user models as "data explorers", metadata models for scientific databases, intelligent assistants and data exploration services. We describe the underlying elements of this approach, specifically the visual database exploration model and the metadata objects that support the model.
Previous accelerated volume rendering techniques have used auxiliary hierarchical datastructures to skip empty and homogeneous regions. Although some recent research has taken advantage of more efficient direct encoding techniques to skip empty regions, no work has been done to directly encode homogeneous but not empty regions. 3D distance transforms previously used to encode empty space can be extended to preprocess homogeneous regions as well, and these regions can be efficiently encoded and incorporated into volume ray-casting and back projection algorithms with a high degree of flexibility.
The paper presents a framework for multiresolution compression and geometric reconstruction of arbitrarily dimensioned data designed for distributed applications. Although being restricted to uniform sampled data, the versatile approach enables the handling of a large variety of real world elements. Examples include nonparametric, parametric and implicit lines, surfaces or volumes, all of which are common to large scale data sets. The framework is based on two fundamental steps: compression is carried out by a remote server and generates a bit-stream transmitted over the underlying network. Geometric reconstruction is performed by the local client and renders a piecewise linear approximation of the data. More precisely, the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients. In addition, geometric constraints such as boundary lines can be compressed in a lossless manner and are incorporated into the resulting bit-stream. The reconstruction pipeline performs a piecewise adaptive linear approximation of data using a fast and easy to use point removal strategy which works with any subsequent triangulation technique.
We present a new technique for extracting regions of interest (ROI) applying a local watershed transformation. The proposed strategy for computing catchment basins in a given region of interest is based on a rain-falling simulation. Unlike the standard watershed algorithms, which flood the complete (gradient magnitude of an) image, the proposed approach allows us to perform this task locally. Thus, a controlled region growth is performed, saving time and reducing the memory requirement especially when applied on volume data. A second problem arising from the standard watershed transformation is the over-segmented result and the lack of sound criteria for merging the computed basins. For overcoming this drawback, we present a basin-merging strategy introducing four criteria for merging adjacent basins. The threshold values applied in this strategy are derived from the user input and match rather the attributes of the selected object than of all objects in the image. In doing so, the user is not required to adjust abstract numbers, but to simply select a coarse region of interest. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not limited to the 2D case. As we show in this work, it is suitable for volume data processing as well. Finally, we present the results of applying the proposed approach on several example images and volume data sets.
Existing parallel or remote rendering solutions rely on communicating pixels, OpenGL commands, scene-graph changes or application-specific data. We propose an intermediate solution based on a set of independent graphics primitives that use hardware shaders to specify their visual appearance. Compared to an OpenGL based approach, it reduces the complexity of the model by eliminating most fixed function parameters while giving access to the latest functionalities of graphics cards. It also suppresses the OpenGL state machine that creates data dependencies making primitive re-scheduling difficult. Using a retained-mode communication protocol transmitting changes between each frame, combined with the possibility to use shaders to implement interactive data processing operations instead of sending final colors and geometry, we are able to optimize the network load. High level information such as bounding volumes is used to setup advanced schemes where primitives are issued in parallel, routed according to their visibility, merged and re-ordered when received for rendering. Different optimization algorithms can be efficiently implemented, saving network bandwidth or reducing texture switches for instance. We present performance results based on two VTK applications, a parallel iso-surface extraction and a parallel volume renderer. We compare our approach with Chromium. Results show that our approach leads to significantly better performance and scalability, while offering easy access to hardware accelerated rendering algorithms.
With the exponential growth in size of geometric data, it is becoming increasingly important to make effective use of multilevel caches, limited disk storage, and bandwidth. As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.
The method of Moving Least Squares (MLS) is a popular framework for reconstructing continuous functions from scattered data due to its rich mathematical properties and well-understood theoretical foundations. This paper applies MLS to volume rendering, providing a unified mathematical framework for ray casting of scalar data stored over regular as well as irregular grids. We use the MLS reconstruction to render smooth isosurfaces and to compute accurate derivatives for high-quality shading effects. We also present a novel, adaptive preintegration scheme to improve the efficiency of the ray casting algorithm by reducing the overall number of function evaluations, and an efficient implementation of our framework exploiting modern graphics hardware. The resulting system enables high-quality volume integration and shaded isosurface rendering for regular and irregular volume data.
The authors discuss various visualization techniques that have the goal of identifying unwanted curvature regions interactively on screen. The authors give a critical survey of surface interrogation methods. Several isoline and contouring techniques are presented, and the reflection line method, which simulates the so-called light cage by computer graphics, is presented. The isophote method analyzes surfaces by determining lines of equal light intensity. Silhouettes are special isophotes. A different approach to these problems is the mapping-technique. The mapping methods recognize unwanted curvature regions by detecting singularities of a special mapping of the curve or surface investigated. Curvature plots are a practical means of analyzing free-form surfaces. All these methods are effective, but generally need a lot of computational effort. The free-form surface visualization by ray tracing is discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A high-performance algorithm for generating isosurfaces is presented. In this algorithm, extrema points in a scalar field are first extracted. A graph is then generated in which the extrema points are taken as nodes. Each arc of the graph has a list of IDs of the cells that are intersected by the arc. A boundary cell list ordered according to cells' values is also generated. The graph and the list generated in this pre-process are used as a guide in searching for seed cells. Isosurfaces are generated from seed cells that are found in arcs of the graph. In this process, isosurfaces appear to propagate themselves. The algorithm visits only cells that are intersected by an isosurface and cells whose IDs an included in cell lists. It is especially efficient when many isosurfaces are interactively generated in a huge volume. Some benchmark tests described show the efficiency of the algorithm.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Computer-based surgical simulation promises to provide a broader scope of clinical training through the introduction of anatomic variation, simulation of untoward events, and collection of performance data. We present a haptically-enabled surgical simulator for the most common techniques in diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy-cervical dilation, endometrial resection and ablation, and lesion excision. Engineering tradeoffs in developing a real-time, haptic-rate simulator are discussed.
We present a robust, noise-resistant criterion characterizing plane-like skeletons in binary voxel objects. It is based on a distance map and the geodesic distance along the object's boundary. A parameter allows us to control the noise sensitivity. If needed, homotopy with the original object might be reconstructed in a second step, using an improved distance ordered thinning algorithm. The skeleton is analyzed to create a geometric representation for rendering. Plane-like parts are transformed into an triangulated surface not enclosing a volume by a suitable triangulation scheme. The resulting surfaces have lower triangle count than those created with standard methods and tend to maintain the original geometry, even after simplification with a high decimation rate. Our algorithm allows us to interactively render expressive images of complex 3D structures, emphasizing independently plane-like and rod-like structures. The methods are applied for visualization of the microstructure of bone biopsies.
The Internet pervades many aspects of our lives and is becoming indispensable to critical functions in areas such as commerce, government, production and general information dissemination. To maintain the stability and efficiency of the Internet, every effort must be made to protect it against various forms of attacks, malicious users, and errors. A key component in the Internet security effort is the routine examination of Internet routing data, which unfortunately can be too large and complicated to browse directly. We have developed an interactive visualization process which proves to be very effective for the analysis of Internet routing data. In this application paper, we show how each step in the visualization process helps direct the analysis and glean insights from the data. These insights include the discovery of patterns, detection of faults and abnormal events, understanding of event correlations, formation of causation hypotheses, and classification of anomalies. We also discuss lessons learned in our visual analysis study.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the human brain, coupled with tractography techniques, enable the extraction of large- collections of three-dimensional tract pathways per subject. These pathways and pathway bundles represent the connectivity between different brain regions and are critical for the understanding of brain related diseases. A flexible and efficient GPU-based rendering technique for DTI tractography data is presented that addresses common performance bottlenecks and image-quality issues, allowing interactive render rates to be achieved on commodity hardware. An occlusion query-based pathway LoD management system for streamlines/streamtubes/tuboids is introduced that optimizes input geometry, vertex processing, and fragment processing loads, and helps reduce overdraw. The tuboid, a fully-shaded streamtube impostor constructed entirely on the GPU from streamline vertices, is also introduced. Unlike full streamtubes and other impostor constructs, tuboids require little to no preprocessing or extra space over the original streamline data. The supported fragment processing levels of detail range from texture-based draft shading to full raycast normal computation, Phong shading, environment mapping, and curvature-correct text labeling. The presented text labeling technique for tuboids provides adaptive, aesthetically pleasing labels that appear attached to the surface of the tubes. Furthermore, an occlusion query aggregating and scheduling scheme for tuboids is described that reduces the query overhead. Results for a tractography dataset are presented, and demonstrate that LoD-managed tuboids offer benefits over traditional streamtubes both in performance and appearance.
A scalar volume V={(x,f(x))|x/spl isin/R} is described by a function f(x) defined over some region R of the three dimensional space. The paper presents a simple technique for rendering interval sets of the form I/sub g/(a,b)={(x,f(x))|a/spl les/g(x)/spl les/b}, where a and b are either real numbers of infinities. We describe an algorithm for triangulating interval sets as /spl alpha/ shapes, which can be accurately and efficiently rendered as surfaces or semi transparent clouds. On the theoretical side, interval sets provide an unified approach to isosurface extraction and direct volume rendering. On the practical side, interval sets add flexibility to scalar volume visualization-we may choose to, for example, have an interactive, high quality display of the volume surrounding or "inside" an isosurface when such display for the entire volume is too expensive to produce.
The paper discusses techniques for extracting feature lines from three-dimensional unstructured grids. The twin objectives are to facilitate the interactive manipulation of these typically very large and dense meshes, and to clarify the visualization of the solution data that accompanies them. The authors describe the perceptual importance of specific viewpoint-dependent and view-independent features, discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of several alternative algorithms for identifying these features (taking into consideration both local and global criteria), and demonstrate the results of these methods on a variety of different data sets.
Presents an algorithm that uses partitioning and gluing to compress large triangular meshes which are too complex to fit in main memory. The algorithm is based largely on the existing mesh compression algorithms, most of which require an 'in-core' representation of the input mesh. Our solution is to partition the mesh into smaller submeshes and compress these submeshes separately using existing mesh compression techniques. Since a direct partition of the input mesh is out of question, instead we partition a simplified mesh and use the partition on the simplified model to obtain a partition on the original model. In order to recover the full connectivity, we present a simple scheme for encoding/decoding the resulting boundary structure from the mesh partition. When compressing large models with few singular vertices, a negligible portion of the compressed output is devoted to gluing information. On desktop computers, we have run experiments on models with millions of vertices, which could not be compressed using standard compression software packages, and have observed compression ratios as high as 17 to 1 using our technique.
Weather visualization is a difficult problem because it comprises volumetric multi-field data and traditional surface-based approaches obscure details of the complex three-dimensional structure of cloud dynamics. Therefore, visually accurate volumetric multi-field visualization of storm scale and cloud scale data is needed to effectively and efficiently communicate vital information to weather forecasters, improving storm forecasting, atmospheric dynamics models, and weather spotter training. We have developed a new approach to multi-field visualization that uses field specific, physically-based opacity, transmission, and lighting calculations per-field for the accurate visualization of storm and cloud scale weather data. Our approach extends traditional transfer function approaches to multi-field data and to volumetric illumination and scattering.
Recent advances in algorithms and graphics hardware have opened the possibility to render tetrahedral grids at interactive rates on commodity PCs. This paper extends on this work in that it presents a direct volume rendering method for such grids which supports both current and upcoming graphics hardware architectures, large and deformable grids, as well as different rendering options. At the core of our method is the idea to perform the sampling of tetrahedral elements along the view rays entirely in local barycentric coordinates. Then, sampling requires minimum GPU memory and texture access operations, and it maps efficiently onto a feed-forward pipeline of multiple stages performing computation and geometry construction. We propose to spawn rendered elements from one single vertex. This makes the method amenable to upcoming Direct3D 10 graphics hardware which allows to create geometry on the GPU. By only modifying the algorithm slightly it can be used to render per-pixel iso-surfaces and to perform tetrahedral cell projection. As our method neither requires any pre-processing nor an intermediate grid representation it can efficiently deal with dynamic and large 3D meshes
The Network for computational nanotechnology (NCN) has developed a science gateway at nanoHUB.org for nanotechnology education and research. Remote users can browse through online seminars and courses, and launch sophisticated nanotechnology simulation tools, all within their Web browser. Simulations are supported by a middleware that can route complex jobs to grid supercomputing resources. But what is truly unique about the middleware is the way that it uses hardware accelerated graphics to support both problem setup and result visualization. This paper describes the design and integration of a remote visualization framework into the nanoHUB for interactive visual analytics of nanotechnology simulations. Our services flexibly handle a variety of nanoscience simulations, render them utilizing graphics hardware acceleration in a scalable manner, and deliver them seamlessly through the middleware to the user. Rendering is done only on-demand, as needed, so each graphics hardware unit can simultaneously support many user sessions. Additionally, a novel node distribution scheme further improves our system's scalability. Our approach is not only efficient but also cost-effective. Only half-dozen render nodes are anticipated to support hundreds of active tool sessions on the nanoHUB. Moreover, this architecture and visual analytics environment provides capabilities that can serve many areas of scientific simulation and analysis beyond nanotechnology with its ability to interactively analyze and visualize multivariate scalar and vector fields
Although real-time interactive volume rendering is available even for very large data sets, this visualization method is used quite rarely in the clinical practice. We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre-computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint. Our system provides the physician with synchronized views which help to gain deeper insight into the medical data with minimal user interaction.
In this work we present basic methodology for interactive volume editing on GPUs, and we demonstrate the use of these methods to achieve a number of different effects. We present fast techniques to modify the appearance and structure of volumetric scalar fields given on Cartesian grids. Similar to 2D circular brushes as used in surface painting we present 3D spherical brushes for intuitive coloring of particular structures in such fields. This paint metaphor is extended to allow the user to change the data itself, and the use of this functionality for interactive structure isolation, hole filling, and artefact removal is demonstrated. Building on previous work in the field we introduce high-resolution selection volumes, which can be seen as a resolution-based focus+context metaphor. By utilizing such volumes we present a novel approach to interactive volume editing at sub-voxel accuracy. Finally, we introduce a fast technique to paste textures onto iso-surfaces in a 3D scalar field. Since the texture resolution is independent of the volume resolution, this technique allows structure-aligned textures containing appearance properties or textual information to be used for volume augmentation and annotation.
The widespread use of computational simulation in science and engineering provides challenging research opportunities. Multiple independent variables are considered and large and complex data are computed, especially in the case of multi-run simulation. Classical visualization techniques deal well with 2D or 3D data and also with time-dependent data. Additional independent dimensions, however, provide interesting new challenges. We present an advanced visual analysis approach that enables a thorough investigation of families of data surfaces, i.e., datasets, with respect to pairs of independent dimensions. While it is almost trivial to visualize one such data surface, the visual exploration and analysis of many such data surfaces is a grand challenge, stressing the users' perception and cognition. We propose an approach that integrates projections and aggregations of the data surfaces at different levels (one scalar aggregate per surface, a 1D profile per surface, or the surface as such). We demonstrate the necessity for a flexible visual analysis system that integrates many different (linked) views for making sense of this highly complex data. To demonstrate its usefulness, we exemplify our approach in the context of a meteorological multi-run simulation data case and in the context of the engineering domain, where our collaborators are working with the simulation of elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication bearing in the automotive industry.
In this paper we describe a novel method to integrate interactive visual analysis and machine learning to support the insight generation of the user. The suggested approach combines the vast search and processing power of the computer with the superior reasoning and pattern recognition capabilities of the human user. An evolutionary search algorithm has been adapted to assist in the fuzzy logic formalization of hypotheses that aim at explaining features inside multivariate, volumetric data. Up to now, users solely rely on their knowledge and expertise when looking for explanatory theories. However, it often remains unclear whether the selected attribute ranges represent the real explanation for the feature of interest. Other selections hidden in the large number of data variables could potentially lead to similar features. Moreover, as simulation complexity grows, users are confronted with huge multidimensional data sets making it almost impossible to find meaningful hypotheses at all. We propose an interactive cycle of knowledge-based analysis and automatic hypothesis generation. Starting from initial hypotheses, created with linking and brushing, the user steers a heuristic search algorithm to look for alternative or related hypotheses. The results are analyzed in information visualization views that are linked to the volume rendering. Individual properties as well as global aggregates are visually presented to provide insight into the most relevant aspects of the generated hypotheses. This novel approach becomes computationally feasible due to a GPU implementation of the time-critical parts in the algorithm. A thorough evaluation of search times and noise sensitivity as well as a case study on data from the automotive domain substantiate the usefulness of the suggested approach.
We present topological spines-a new visual representation that preserves the topological and geometric structure of a scalar field. This representation encodes the spatial relationships of the extrema of a scalar field together with the local volume and nesting structure of the surrounding contours. Unlike other topological representations, such as contour trees, our approach preserves the local geometric structure of the scalar field, including structural cycles that are useful for exposing symmetries in the data. To obtain this representation, we describe a novel mechanism based on the extraction of extremum graphs-sparse subsets of the Morse-Smale complex that retain the important structural information without the clutter and occlusion problems that arise from visualizing the entire complex directly. Extremum graphs form a natural multiresolution structure that allows the user to suppress noise and enhance topological features via the specification of a persistence range. Applications of our approach include the visualization of 3D scalar fields without occlusion artifacts, and the exploratory analysis of high-dimensional functions.
Proposes a new approach to the automatic generation of triangular irregular networks (TINs) from dense terrain models. We have developed and implemented an algorithm based on the greedy principle used to compute minimum-link paths in polygons. Our algorithm works by taking greedy cuts ("bites") out of a simple closed polygon that bounds the yet-to-be triangulated region. The algorithm starts with a large polygon, bounding the whole extent of the terrain to be triangulated, and works its way inward, performing at each step one of three basic operations: ear cutting, greedy biting, and edge splitting. We give experimental evidence that our method is competitive with current algorithms and has the potential to be faster and to generate many fewer triangles. Also, it is able to keep the structural terrain fidelity at almost no extra cost in running time and it requires very little memory beyond that for the input height array.
An efficient algorithm is presented for computing particle paths, streak lines and time lines in time-dependent flows with moving curvilinear grids. The integration, velocity interpolation, and step size control are all performed in physical space which avoids the need to transform the velocity field into computational space. This leads to higher accuracy because there are no Jacobian matrix approximations, and expensive matrix inversions are eliminated. Integration accuracy is maintained using an adaptive step size control scheme which is regulated by the path line curvature. The problem of point location and interpolation in physical space is simplified by decomposing hexahedral cells into tetrahedral cells. This enables the point location to be done analytically and substantially faster than with a Newton-Raphson iterative method. Results presented show this algorithm is up to six times faster than particle tracers which operate on hexahedral cells, and produces almost identical traces.
The paper presents interactive flow visualization methods that highlight directional information in the flow field. An added benefit of the proposed methods is that they reduce the amount of data being displayed and hence reduce clutter. The main idea behind these methods is the use of light sources to select and highlight regions in the flow field with similar directions. Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization. The authors apply these methods to an analytic data set to help explain how they work, and then to a simulation data set to highlight flow reversals.
The authors present an efficient visualization approach to support multivariate data exploration through a simple but effective low dimensional data overview based on metric scaling. A multivariate dataset is first transformed into a set of dissimilarities between all pairs of data records. A graph configuration algorithm based on principal components is then wed to determine the display coordinates of the data records in the low dimensional data overview. This overview provides a graphical summary of the multivariate data with reduced data dimensions, reduced data size, and additional data semantics. It can be used to enhance multidimensional data brushing, or to arrange the layout of other conventional multivariate visualization techniques. Real life data is used to demonstrate the approach.
Segmentation of the tracheo-bronchial tree of the lungs is notoriously difficult. This is due to the fact that the small size of some of the anatomical structures is subject to partial volume effects. Furthermore, the limited intensity contrast between the participating materials (air, blood, and tissue) increases the segmentation of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which is based on a pipeline of three segmentation stages to extract the lower airways down to the seventh generation of the bronchi. User interaction is limited to the specification of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea at the upper end of the lower airways. Similarly, the complementary vascular tree of the lungs can be segmented. Furthermore, we modified our virtual endoscopy system to visualize the vascular and airway system of the lungs along with other features, such as lung tumors.
Visibility culling has the potential to accelerate large data visualization in significant ways. Unfortunately, existing algorithms do not scale well when parallelized, and require full re-computation whenever the opacity transfer function is modified. To address these issues, we have designed a Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF) scheme to encode the view-dependent opacity of a volume block. POFs are computed off-line during a pre-processing stage, only once for each block. We show that using POFs is (i) an efficient, conservative and effective way to encode the opacity variations of a volume block for a range of views, (ii) flexible for re-use by a family of opacity transfer functions without the need for additional off-line processing, and (iii) highly scalable for use in massively parallel implementations. Our results confirm the efficacy of POFs for visibility culling in large-scale parallel volume rendering; we can interactively render the Visible Woman dataset using software ray-casting on 32 processors, with interactive modification of the opacity transfer function on-the-fly.
Visualization of uncertainty or error in astrophysical data is seldom available in simulations of astronomical phenomena, and yet almost all rendered attributes possess some degree of uncertainty due to observational error. Uncertainties associated with spatial location typically vary significantly with scale and thus introduce further complexity in the interpretation of a given visualization. This paper introduces effective techniques for visualizing uncertainty in large-scale virtual astrophysical environments. Building upon our previous transparently scalable visualization architecture, we develop tools that enhance the perception and comprehension of uncertainty across wide scale ranges. Our methods include a unified color-coding scheme for representing log-scale distances and percentage errors, an ellipsoid model to represent positional uncertainty, an ellipsoid envelope model to expose trajectory uncertainty, and a magic-glass design supporting the selection of ranges of log-scale distance and uncertainty parameters, as well as an overview mode and a scalable WIM tool for exposing the magnitudes of spatial context and uncertainty.
In a user study comparing four visualization methods for three-dimensional vector data, participants used visualizations from each method to perform five simple but representative tasks: 1) determining whether a given point was a critical point, 2) determining the type of a critical point, 3) determining whether an integral curve would advect through two points, 4) determining whether swirling movement is present at a point, and 5) determining whether the vector field is moving faster at one point than another. The visualization methods were line and tube representations of integral curves with both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing. While participants reported a preference for stereo lines, quantitative results showed performance among the tasks varied by method. Users performed all tasks better with methods that: 1) gave a clear representation with no perceived occlusion, 2) clearly visualized curve speed and direction information, and 3) provided fewer rich 3D cues (e.g., shading, polygonal arrows, overlap cues, and surface textures). These results provide quantitative support for anecdotal evidence on visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also give a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods, and for defining additional tasks to explore further the tradeoffs among the methods.
Due to its nonlinear nature, the climate system shows quite high natural variability on different time scales, including multiyear oscillations such as the El Nino southern oscillation phenomenon. Beside a shift of the mean states and of extreme values of climate variables, climate change may also change the frequency or the spatial patterns of these natural climate variations. Wavelet analysis is a well established tool to investigate variability in the frequency domain. However, due to the size and complexity of the analysis results, only few time series are commonly analyzed concurrently. In this paper we will explore different techniques to visually assist the user in the analysis of variability and variability changes to allow for a holistic analysis of a global climate model data set consisting of several variables and extending over 250 years. Our new framework and data from the IPCC AR4 simulations with the coupled climate model ECHAM5/MPI-OM are used to explore the temporal evolution of El Nino due to climate change.
In order to develop a foundation for visualization, we develop lattice models for data objects and displays that focus on the fact that data objects are approximations to mathematical objects and real displays are approximations to ideal displays. These lattice models give us a way to quantize the information content of data and displays and to define conditions on the visualization mappings from data to displays. Mappings satisfy these conditions if and only if they are lattice isomorphisms. We show how to apply this result to scientific data and display models, and discuss how it might be applied to recursively defined data types appropriate for complex information processing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Proposes as a generalization of isosurfaces, the 'interval volume', which is a new type of geometric model representing 3D subvolumes with field values belonging to a closed interval. A dominant surface fitting algorithm called 'marching cubes' is extended to obtain a solid fitting algorithm, which extracts from a given volumetric dataset a high-resolution polyhedral solid data structure of the interval volume. Rendering methods for the interval volume and principal related operations are also presented. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated with 4D simulated data from atomic collision research.
Critical points of a vector field are key to their characterization. Their positions as well as their indexes are crucial for understanding vector fields. Considerable work exists in 2D, but less is available for 3D or higher dimensions. Geometric algebra is a derivative of Clifford algebra that not only enables a succinct definition of the index of a critical point in higher dimension; it also provides insight and computational pathways for calculating the index. We describe the problems in terms of geometric algebra and present an octree based solution using the algebra for finding critical points and their index in a 3D vector field.
This work describes the methods used to produce an interactive visualization of a 2 TB computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data set using particle tracing (streaklines). We use the method introduced by Bruckschen el al. (2001) that precomputes a large number of particles, stores them on disk using a space-filling curve ordering that minimizes seeks, then retrieves and displays the particles according to the user's command. We describe how the particle computation can be performed using a PC cluster, how the algorithm can be adapted to work with a multiblock curvilinear mesh, how scalars can be extracted and used to color the particles, and how the out-of-core visualization can be scaled to 293 billion particles while still achieving interactive performance on PC hardware. Compared to the earlier work, our data set size and total number of particles are an order of magnitude larger. We also describe a new compression technique that losslessly reduces the amount of particle storage by 41% and speeds the particle retrieval by about 20%.
Hardware-accelerated direct volume rendering of unstructured volumetric meshes is often based on tetrahedral cell projection, in particular, the projected tetrahedra (PT) algorithm and its variants. Unfortunately, even implementations of the most advanced variants of the PT algorithm are very prone to rendering artifacts. In this work, we identify linear interpolation in screen coordinates as a cause for significant rendering artifacts and implement the correct perspective interpolation for the PT algorithm with programmable graphics hardware. We also demonstrate how to use features of modern graphics hardware to improve the accuracy of the coloring of individual tetrahedra and the compositing of the resulting colors, in particular, by employing a logarithmic scale for the preintegrated color lookup table, using textures with high color resolution, rendering to floating-point color buffers, and alpha dithering. Combined with a correct visibility ordering, these techniques result in the first implementation of the PT algorithm without objectionable rendering artifacts. Apart from the important improvement in rendering quality, our approach also provides a test bed for different implementations of the PT algorithm that allows us to study the particular rendering artifacts introduced by these variants.
Current computer architectures employ caching to improve the performance of a wide variety of applications. One of the main characteristics of such cache schemes is the use of block fetching whenever an uncached data element is accessed. To maximize the benefit of the block fetching mechanism, we present novel cache-aware and cache-oblivious layouts of surface and volume meshes that improve the performance of interactive visualization and geometric processing algorithms. Based on a general I/O model, we derive new cache-aware and cache-oblivious metrics that have high correlations with the number of cache misses when accessing a mesh. In addition to guiding the layout process, our metrics can be used to quantify the quality of a layout, e.g. for comparing different layouts of the same mesh and for determining whether a given layout is amenable to significant improvement. We show that layouts of unstructured meshes optimized for our metrics result in improvements over conventional layouts in the performance of visualization applications such as isosurface extraction and view-dependent rendering. Moreover, we improve upon recent cache-oblivious mesh layouts in terms of performance, applicability, and accuracy
Pipeline architectures provide a versatile and efficient mechanism for constructing visualizations, and they have been implemented in numerous libraries and applications over the past two decades. In addition to allowing developers and users to freely combine algorithms, visualization pipelines have proven to work well when streaming data and scale well on parallel distributed- memory computers. However, current pipeline visualization frameworks have a critical flaw: they are unable to manage time varying data. As data flows through the pipeline, each algorithm has access to only a single snapshot in time of the data. This prevents the implementation of algorithms that do any temporal processing such as particle tracing; plotting over time; or interpolation, fitting, or smoothing of time series data. As data acquisition technology improves, as simulation time-integration techniques become more complex, and as simulations save less frequently and regularly, the ability to analyze the time-behavior of data becomes more important. This paper describes a modification to the traditional pipeline architecture that allows it to accommodate temporal algorithms. Furthermore, the architecture allows temporal algorithms to be used in conjunction with algorithms expecting a single time snapshot, thus simplifying software design and allowing adoption into existing pipeline frameworks. Our architecture also continues to work well in parallel distributed-memory environments. We demonstrate our architecture by modifying the popular VTK framework and exposing the functionality to the ParaView application. We use this framework to apply time-dependent algorithms on large data with a parallel cluster computer and thereby exercise a functionality that previously did not exist.
This paper presents a novel and efficient surface matching and visualization framework through the geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image diffusion. Based on conformal geometry, our approach can uniquely map a 3D surface to a canonical rectangular domain and encode the shape characteristics (e.g., mean curvatures and conformal factors) of the surface in the 2D domain to construct a geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image, where the distances between sampling pixels are not uniform but the actual geodesic distances on the manifold. Through the novel geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image diffusion presented in this paper, we can create a multiscale diffusion space, in which the cross-scale extrema can be detected as the robust geometric features for the matching and registration of surfaces. Therefore, statistical analysis and visualization of surface properties across subjects become readily available. The experiments on scanned surface models show that our method is very robust for feature extraction and surface matching even under noise and resolution change. We have also applied the framework on the real 3D human neocortical surfaces, and demonstrated the excellent performance of our approach in statistical analysis and integrated visualization of the multimodality volumetric data over the shape vector image.
We present a toolbox for quickly interpreting and illustrating 2D slices of seismic volumetric reflection data. Searching for oil and gas involves creating a structural overview of seismic reflection data to identify hydrocarbon reservoirs. We improve the search of seismic structures by precalculating the horizon structures of the seismic data prior to interpretation. We improve the annotation of seismic structures by applying novel illustrative rendering algorithms tailored to seismic data, such as deformed texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The illustrative rendering results in multi-attribute and scale invariant visualizations where features are represented clearly in both highly zoomed in and zoomed out views. Thumbnail views in combination with interactive appearance control allows for a quick overview of the data before detailed interpretation takes place. These techniques help reduce the work of seismic illustrators and interpreters.
Extracting and visualizing temporal patterns in large scientific data is an open problem in visualization research. First, there are few proven methods to flexibly and concisely define general temporal patterns for visualization. Second, with large time-dependent data sets, as typical with todaypsilas large-scale simulations, scalable and general solutions for handling the data are still not widely available. In this work, we have developed a textual pattern matching approach for specifying and identifying general temporal patterns. Besides defining the formalism of the language, we also provide a working implementation with sufficient efficiency and scalability to handle large data sets. Using recent large-scale simulation data from multiple application domains, we demonstrate that our visualization approach is one of the first to empower a concept driven exploration of large-scale time-varying multivariate data.
We develop an interactive analysis and visualization tool for probabilistic segmentation in medical imaging. The originality of our approach is that the data exploration is guided by shape and appearance knowledge learned from expert-segmented images of a training population. We introduce a set of multidimensional transfer function widgets to analyze the multivariate probabilistic field data. These widgets furnish the user with contextual information about conformance or deviation from the population statistics. We demonstrate the user's ability to identify suspicious regions (e.g. tumors) and to correct the misclassification results. We evaluate our system and demonstrate its usefulness in the context of static anatomical and time-varying functional imaging datasets.
Current software visualization tools are inadequate for understanding, debugging, and tuning realistically complex applications. These tools often present only static structure, or they present dynamics from only a few of the many layers of a program and its underlying system. This paper introduces "PV", a prototype program visualization system which provides concurrent visual presentation of behavior from all layers, including: the program itself, user-level libraries, the operating system, and the hardware, as this behavior unfolds over time. PV juxtaposes views from different layers in order to facilitate visual correlation, and allows these views to be navigated in a coordinated fashion. This results in an extremely powerful mechanism for exploring application behavior. Experience is presented from actual use of PV in production settings with programmers facing real deadlines and serious performance problems.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Whilst there has been considerable effort in constructing force feedback devices for use in virtual environments, and in the use of touch as a prosthesis for the blind, there has been little work on the use of touch in the visualisation or more properly, perceptualisation of data. Touch potentially offers an additional dimension of perception where visualisation is limited by screen size, resolution, and visual overload. We describe some tactile mice and experiments in using tactile mice for a variety of perceptualisation tasks.
Irregular tetrahedral meshes, which are popular in many engineering and scientific applications, often contain a large number of vertices. A mesh of V vertices and T tetrahedra requires 48 V bits or less to store the vertex coordinates, 4/spl middot/T/spl middot/log/sub 2/(V) bits to store the tetrahedra-vertex incidence relations, also called connectivity information, and kV bits to store the k-bit value samples associated with the vertices. Given that T is 5 to 7 times larger than V and that V often exceeds 32/sup 3/, the storage space required for the connectivity is larger than 300 V bits and thus dominates the overall storage cost. Our "implants spray" compression approach introduced in the paper reduces this cost to about 30 V bits or less-a 10:1 compression ratio. Furthermore, implant spray supports the progressive refinement of a crude model through a series of vertex-splits operations.
A glyph-based method for visualizing the nematic liquid crystal alignment tensor is introduced. Unlike previous approaches, the glyph is based upon physically-linked metrics, not offsets of the eigenvalues. These metrics, combined with a set of superellipsoid shapes, communicate both the strength of the crystal's uniaxial alignment and the amount of biaxiality. With small modifications, our approach can visualize any real symmetric traceless tensor
Rhinologists are often faced with the challenge of assessing nasal breathing from a functional point of view to derive effective therapeutic interventions. While the complex nasal anatomy can be revealed by visual inspection and medical imaging, only vague information is available regarding the nasal airflow itself: Rhinomanometry delivers rather unspecific integral information on the pressure gradient as well as on total flow and nasal flow resistance. In this article we demonstrate how the understanding of physiological nasal breathing can be improved by simulating and visually analyzing nasal airflow, based on an anatomically correct model of the upper human respiratory tract. In particular we demonstrate how various information visualization (InfoVis) techniques, such as a highly scalable implementation of parallel coordinates, time series visualizations, as well as unstructured grid multi-volume rendering, all integrated within a multiple linked views framework, can be utilized to gain a deeper understanding of nasal breathing. Evaluation is accomplished by visual exploration of spatio-temporal airflow characteristics that include not only information on flow features but also on accompanying quantities such as temperature and humidity. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth visual exploration of the physiological function of the nose over several simulated breathing cycles under consideration of a complete model of the nasal airways, realistic boundary conditions, and all physically relevant time-varying quantities.
Parameterization of complex surfaces constitutes a major means of visualizing highly convoluted geometric structures as well as other properties associated with the surface. It also enables users with the ability to navigate, orient, and focus on regions of interest within a global view and overcome the occlusions to inner concavities. In this paper, we propose a novel area-preserving surface parameterization method which is rigorous in theory, moderate in computation, yet easily extendable to surfaces of non-disc and closed-boundary topologies. Starting from the distortion induced by an initial parameterization, an area restoring diffeomorphic flow is constructed as a Lie advection of differential 2-forms along the manifold, which yields equality of the area elements between the domain and the original surface at its final state. Existence and uniqueness of result are assured through an analytical derivation. Based upon a triangulated surface representation, we also present an efficient algorithm in line with discrete differential modeling. As an exemplar application, the utilization of this method for the effective visualization of brain cortical imaging modalities is presented. Compared with conformal methods, our method can reveal more subtle surface patterns in a quantitative manner. It, therefore, provides a competitive alternative to the existing parameterization techniques for better surface-based analysis in various scenarios.
Large observations and simulations in scientific research give rise to high-dimensional data sets that present many challenges and opportunities in data analysis and visualization. Researchers in application domains such as engineering, computational biology, climate study, imaging and motion capture are faced with the problem of how to discover compact representations of highdimensional data while preserving their intrinsic structure. In many applications, the original data is projected onto low-dimensional space via dimensionality reduction techniques prior to modeling. One problem with this approach is that the projection step in the process can fail to preserve structure in the data that is only apparent in high dimensions. Conversely, such techniques may create structural illusions in the projection, implying structure not present in the original high-dimensional data. Our solution is to utilize topological techniques to recover important structures in high-dimensional data that contains non-trivial topology. Specifically, we are interested in high-dimensional branching structures. We construct local circle-valued coordinate functions to represent such features. Subsequently, we perform dimensionality reduction on the data while ensuring such structures are visually preserved. Additionally, we study the effects of global circular structures on visualizations. Our results reveal never-before-seen structures on real-world data sets from a variety of applications.
Large scale and structurally complex volume datasets from high-resolution 3D imaging devices or computational simulations pose a number of technical challenges for interactive visual analysis. In this paper, we present the first integration of a multiscale volume representation based on tensor approximation within a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multiresolution rendering framework. Specific contributions include (a) a hierarchical brick-tensor decomposition approach for pre-processing large volume data, (b) a GPU accelerated tensor reconstruction implementation exploiting CUDA capabilities, and (c) an effective tensor-specific quantization strategy for reducing data transfer bandwidth and out-of-core memory footprint. Our multiscale representation allows for the extraction, analysis and display of structural features at variable spatial scales, while adaptive level-of-detail rendering methods make it possible to interactively explore large datasets within a constrained memory footprint. The quality and performance of our prototype system is evaluated on large structurally complex datasets, including gigabyte-sized micro-tomographic volumes.
The device unified interface is a generalized and easily expandable protocol for the communication between applications and input devices. The key idea is to unify various device data into the parameters of a so-called "virtual input device." The device information-base, which includes device dependent information, is also incorporated into the virtual input device. Using the device unified interface, system builders are able to design their applications independent of the input devices as well as utilize the capabilities of several devices in the same application.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In computational fluid dynamics visualization is a frequently used tool for data evaluation, understanding of flow characteristics, and qualitative comparison to flow visualizations originating from experiments. Building on an existing visualization software system, that allows for a careful selection of state-of-the-art visualization techniques and some extensions, it became possible to present various features of the data in a single image. The visualizations show vortex position and rotation as well as skin-friction lines, experimental oil-flow traces, and shock-wave positions. By adding experimental flow visualization a comparison between numerical simulation and wind-tunnel flow becomes possible up to a high level of detail. Since some of the underlying algorithms are not yet described in detail in the visualization literature, some experiences gained from the implementation are illustrated.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper presents a splatting algorithm for volume rendering of curvilinear grids. A stochastic sampling technique called Poisson sphere/ellipsoid sampling is employed to adaptively resample a curvilinear grid with a set of randomly distributed points whose energy support extents are well approximated by spheres and ellipsoids. Filter kernels corresponding to these spheres and ellipsoids are used to generate the volume rendered image of the curvilinear grid with a conventional footprint evaluation algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach can be regarded as an alternative to existing fast volume rendering techniques of curvilinear grids.
The Virtual Workbench (VW) is a non-immersive virtual environment that allows users to view and interact with stereoscopic objects displayed on a workspace similar to a tabletop workspace used in day-to-day life. A VW is an ideal environment for collaborative work where several colleagues can gather around the table to study 3D virtual objects. The Virtual Reality laboratory at the Naval Research Laboratory has implemented the VW using a concept similar to (Froehlich et al., 1994). This paper investigates how the VW can be used as a non-immersive display device for understanding and interpreting complex objects encountered in the scientific visualization field. Different techniques for interacting with 3D visualization objects on the table and using VW as a display device for visualization are evaluated using several cases.
The paper describes the architecture of a data level comparative visualization system and experiences using it to study computational fluid dynamics data and experimental wind tunnel data. We illustrate how the system can be used to compare data sets from different sources, data sets with different resolutions and data sets computed using different mathematical models of fluid flow. Suggested improvements to the system based on user feedback are also discussed.
While many methods exist for visualising scalar and vector data, visualisation of tensor data is still troublesome. We present a method for visualising second order tensors in three dimensions using a hybrid between direct volume rendering and glyph rendering. An overview scalar field is created by using three-dimensional adaptive filtering of a scalar field containing noise. The filtering process is controlled by the tensor field to be visualised, creating patterns that characterise the tensor field. By combining direct volume rendering of the scalar field with standard glyph rendering methods for detailed tensor visualisation, a hybrid solution is created. A combined volume and glyph renderer was implemented and tested with both synthetic tensors and strain-rate tensors from the human heart muscle, calculated from phase contrast magnetic resonance image data. A comprehensible result could be obtained, giving both an overview of the tensor field as well as detailed information on individual tensors.
We present a method for stochastic fiber tract mapping from diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) implemented on graphics hardware. From the simulated fibers we compute a connectivity map that gives an indication of the probability that two points in the dataset are connected by a neuronal fiber path. A Bayesian formulation of the fiber model is given and it is shown that the inversion method can be used to construct plausible connectivity. An implementation of this fiber model on the graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. Since the fiber paths can be stochastically generated independently of one another, the algorithm is highly parallelizable. This allows us to exploit the data-parallel nature of the GPU fragment processors. We also present a framework for the connectivity computation on the GPU. Our implementation allows the user to interactively select regions of interest and observe the evolving connectivity results during computation. Results are presented from the stochastic generation of over 250,000 fiber steps per iteration at interactive frame rates on consumer-grade graphics hardware.
We propose a new perception-guided compositing operator for color blending. The operator maintains the same rules for achromatic compositing as standard operators (such as the over operator), but it modifies the computation of the chromatic channels. Chromatic compositing aims at preserving the hue of the input colors; color continuity is achieved by reducing the saturation of colors that are to change their hue value. The main benefit of hue preservation is that color can be used for proper visual labeling, even under the constraint of transparency rendering or image overlays. Therefore, the visualization of nominal data is improved. Hue-preserving blending can be used in any existing compositing algorithm, and it is particularly useful for volume rendering. The usefulness of hue-preserving blending and its visual characteristics are shown for several examples of volume visualization.
We introduce a flexible technique for interactive exploration of vector field data through classification derived from user-specified feature templates. Our method is founded on the observation that, while similar features within the vector field may be spatially disparate, they share similar neighborhood characteristics. Users generate feature-based visualizations by interactively highlighting well-accepted and domain specific representative feature points. Feature exploration begins with the computation of attributes that describe the neighborhood of each sample within the input vector field. Compilation of these attributes forms a representation of the vector field samples in the attribute space. We project the attribute points onto the canonical 2D plane to enable interactive exploration of the vector field using a painting interface. The projection encodes the similarities between vector field points within the distances computed between their associated attribute points. The proposed method is performed at interactive rates for enhanced user experience and is completely flexible as showcased by the simultaneous identification of diverse feature types.
An algorithm for rapid computation of Richards's smooth molecular surface is described. The entire surface is computed analytically, triangulated, and displayed at interactive rates. The faster speeds for our program have been achieved by algorithmic improvements, paralleling the computations, and by taking advantage of the special geometrical properties of such surfaces. Our algorithm is easily parallelable and it has a time complexity of O (k log k) over n processors, where n is the number of atoms of the molecule and k is the average number of neighbors per atom.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper describes a minimally immersive interactive system for visualization of multivariate volumetric data. The system, SFA, uses glyph-based volume rendering which does not suffer the initial costs of isosurface rendering or voxel-based volume rendering, while offering the capability of viewing the entire volume. Glyph rendering also allows the simultaneous display of multiple data values per volume location. Two-handed interaction using three-space magnetic trackers and stereoscopic viewing are combined to produce a minimally immersive volumetric visualization system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the data. We describe the usefulness of this system for visualizing volumetric scalar and vector data. SFA allows the three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation, and analysis of multivariate, time-varying volumetric data, increasing the quantity and clarity of the information conveyed from the visualization system.
We present a novel multiscale approach for flow visualization. We define a local alignment tensor that encodes a measure for alignment to the direction of a given flow field. This tensor induces an anisotropic differential operator on the flow domain, which is discretized with a standard finite element technique. The entries of the corresponding stiffness matrix represent the anisotropically weighted couplings of adjacent nodes of the domain mesh. We use an algebraic multigrid algorithm to generate a hierarchy of fine to coarse descriptions for the above coupling data. This hierarchy comprises a set of coarse grid nodes, a multiscale of basis functions and their corresponding supports. We use these supports to obtain a multilevel decomposition of the flow structure. Standard streamline icons are used to visualize this decomposition at any user-selected level of detail. The method provides a single framework for vector field decomposition independent on the domain dimension or mesh type. Applications are shown in 2D, for flow fields on curved surfaces, and for 3D volumetric flow fields.
Datasets of tens of gigabytes are becoming common in computational and experimental science. This development is driven by advances in imaging technology, producing detectors with growing resolutions, as well as availability of cheap processing power and memory capacity in commodity-based computing clusters. We describe the design of a visualization system that allows scientists to interactively explore large remote data sets in an efficient and flexible way. The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering. Interactive visualization is accomplished using a background thread to access the datasets stored in a multiresolution format. A hierarchical volume tenderer provides seamless integration of high resolution details with low resolution overviews.
For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.
Local shape descriptors compactly characterize regions of a surface, and have been applied to tasks in visualization, shape matching, and analysis. Classically, curvature has be used as a shape descriptor; however, this differential property characterizes only an infinitesimal neighborhood. In this paper, we provide shape descriptors for surface meshes designed to be multi-scale, that is, capable of characterizing regions of varying size. These descriptors capture statistically the shape of a neighborhood around a central point by fitting a quadratic surface. They therefore mimic differential curvature, are efficient to compute, and encode anisotropy. We show how simple variants of mesh operations can be used to compute the descriptors without resorting to expensive parameterizations, and additionally provide a statistical approximation for reduced computational cost. We show how these descriptors apply to a number of uses in visualization, analysis, and matching of surfaces, particularly to tasks in protein surface analysis.
The idea of independently moving, interacting graphical objects is introduced as a method for the visualization of continuous fields. Bird-oid objects or boids are discussed. These boids derive from: (1) icons which are geometric objects whose shape and appearance are related to the field variables, (2) three-dimensional cursors by which a user interactively picks a point in space, (3) particle traces, which are numerically integrated trajectories in space, (4) moving frames of vectors along space curves, and (5) actors, which are programming objects that can create and destroy instances of themselves, act according to internal logic, and communicate with each other and with a user. A software prototype in the C++ language has been developed which demonstrates some of the capabilities of these objects for the visualization of scalar, vector, and tensor fields defined over finite elements or finite volumes.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An experiment in exploratory data visualization using a massively parallel processor is described. In exploratory data visualization, it is typically not known what is being looked for: instead, the data are explored with a variety of visualization techniques that can illuminate its nature by demonstrating patterns in it. With this approach, the authors were able to find new features in some of their oldest datasets and to create more vivid presentations of familiar features in these datasets. Their experience has also led to a better understanding of the nature of the exploratory visualization and has resulted in some formal representations of the interaction process in this environment.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Issues involved in operating a sophisticated scientific instrument as a computer peripheral accessible over a high-speed network are studied. A custom interactive visualization application was constructed to support investigation using a unique computer-controlled high-voltage electron microscope. The researcher's workstation forms the visible third of a triumvirate, along with the instrument and the compute resource. The software was designed to support not only image acquisition, but also many of the tasks that microscope researchers perform in analyzing images. The result of this case study is the identification of some of the issues regarding interacting with scientific instrumentation over high-speed networks and the construction of custom applications to support many of the tasks within a laboratory's research methodology.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A parallel, analytic approach for defining and computing the inter and intra molecular interfaces in three dimensions is described. The molecular interface surfaces are derived from approximations to the power diagrams over the participating molecular units. For a given molecular interface our approach can generate a family of interface surfaces parametrized by /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/, where /spl alpha/ is the radius of the solvent molecule (also known as the probe radius) and /spl beta/ is the interface radius that defines the size of the molecular interface. Molecular interface surfaces provide biochemists with a powerful tool to study surface complementarity and to efficiently characterize the interactions during a protein substrate docking. The complexity of our algorithm for molecular environments is O(nk log/sup 2/ k), where n is the number of atoms in the participating molecular units and k is the average number of neighboring atoms-a constant, given /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/.
The Temporal Bone Dissection Simulator is an ongoing research project for the construction of a synthetic environment suitable for virtual dissection of human temporal bone and related anatomy. Funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the primary goal of this project is to provide a safe, robust, and cost-effective virtual environment for learning the anatomy and surgical procedures associated with the temporal bone. Direct volume visualization has been indispensable for the necessary level of realism and interactivity that is vital to the success of this project. This work is being conducted by the Ohio Supercomputer Center in conjunction with the Department of Otolaryngology at the Ohio State University, and NIDCD.
This paper presents a new technique for the extraction of surfaces from 3D ultrasound data. Surface extraction from ultrasound data is challenging for a number of reasons including noise and artifacts in the images and nonuniform data sampling. A method is proposed to fit an approximating radial basis function to the group of data samples. An explicit surface is then obtained by iso-surfacing the function. In most previous 3D ultrasound research, a pre-processing step is taken to interpolate the data into a regular voxel array and a corresponding loss of resolution. We are the first to represent the set of semi-structured ultrasound pixel data as a single function. From this we are able to extract surfaces without first reconstructing the irregularly spaced pixels into a regular 3D voxel array.
We present a technique to perform occlusion culling for hierarchical terrains at run-time. The algorithm is simple to implement and requires minimal pre-processing and additional storage, yet leads to 2-4 times improvement in framerate for views with high degrees of occlusion. Our method is based on the well-known occlusion horizon algorithm. We show how to adapt the algorithm for use with hierarchical terrains. The occlusion horizon is constructed as the terrain is traversed in an approximate front to back ordering. Regions of the terrain are compared to the horizon to determine when they are completely occluded from the viewpoint. Culling these regions leads to significant savings in rendering.
Motion provides strong visual cues for the perception of shape and depth, as demonstrated by cognitive scientists and visual artists. This paper presents a novel visualization technique-kinetic visualization -that uses particle systems to add supplemental motion cues which can aid in the perception of shape and spatial relationships of static objects. Based on a set of rules following perceptual and physical principles, particles flowing over the surface of an object not only bring out, but also attract attention to, essential information on the shape of the object that might not be readily visible with conventional rendering that uses lighting and view changes. Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that in many cases the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure. The results of a preliminary user study that we have conducted also show evidence that the supplemental motion cues help.
We present a powerful framework for 3D-texture-based rendering of multiple arbitrarily intersecting volumetric datasets. Each volume is represented by a multi-resolution octree-based structure and we use out-of-core techniques to support extremely large volumes. Users define a set of convex polyhedral volume lenses, which may be associated with one or more volumetric datasets. The volumes or the lenses can be interactively moved around while the region inside each lens is rendered using interactively defined multi-volume shaders. Our rendering pipeline splits each lens into multiple convex regions such that each region is homogenous and contains a fixed number of volumes. Each such region is further split by the brick boundaries of the associated octree representations. The resulting puzzle of lens fragments is sorted in front-to-back or back-to-front order using a combination of a view-dependent octree traversal and a GPU-based depth peeling technique. Our current implementation uses slice-based volume rendering and allows interactive roaming through multiple intersecting multi-gigabyte volumes.
In this paper we introduce a visualization technique that provides an abstracted view of the shape and spatio-physico-chemical properties of complex molecules. Unlike existing molecular viewing methods, our approach suppresses small details to facilitate rapid comprehension, yet marks the location of significant features so they remain visible. Our approach uses a combination of filters and mesh restructuring to generate a simplified representation that conveys the overall shape and spatio-physico-chemical properties (e.g. electrostatic charge). Surface markings are then used in the place of important removed details, as well as to supply additional information. These simplified representations are amenable to display using stylized rendering algorithms to further enhance comprehension. Our initial experience suggests that our approach is particularly useful in browsing collections of large molecules and in readily making comparisons between them.
We present a new framework for feature-based statistical analysis of large-scale scientific data and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing features from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion. Turbulent flows are ubiquitous and account for transport and mixing processes in combustion, astrophysics, fusion, and climate modeling among other disciplines. They are also characterized by coherent structure or organized motion, i.e. nonlocal entities whose geometrical features can directly impact molecular mixing and reactive processes. While traditional multi-point statistics provide correlative information, they lack nonlocal structural information, and hence, fail to provide mechanistic causality information between organized fluid motion and mixing and reactive processes. Hence, it is of great interest to capture and track flow features and their statistics together with their correlation with relevant scalar quantities, e.g. temperature or species concentrations. In our approach we encode the set of all possible flow features by pre-computing merge trees augmented with attributes, such as statistical moments of various scalar fields, e.g. temperature, as well as length-scales computed via spectral analysis. The computation is performed in an efficient streaming manner in a pre-processing step and results in a collection of meta-data that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original simulation data. This meta-data is sufficient to support a fully flexible and interactive analysis of the features, allowing for arbitrary thresholds, providing per-feature statistics, and creating various global diagnostics such as Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs), histograms, or time-series. We combine the analysis with a rendering of the features in a linked-view browser that enables scientists to interactively explore, visualize, and analyze the equivalent of one terabyte of simulation data. We highlight the utility of this new framework for combustion science; however, it is applicable to many other science domains.
Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is becoming a standard minimally invasive clinical procedure for the treatment of liver tumors. However, planning the applicator placement such that the malignant tissue is completely destroyed, is a demanding task that requires considerable experience. In this work, we present a fast GPU-based real-time approximation of the ablation zone incorporating the cooling effect of liver vessels. Weighted distance fields of varying RF applicator types are derived from complex numerical simulations to allow a fast estimation of the ablation zone. Furthermore, the heat-sink effect of the cooling blood flow close to the applicator's electrode is estimated by means of a preprocessed thermal equilibrium representation of the liver parenchyma and blood vessels. Utilizing the graphics card, the weighted distance field incorporating the cooling blood flow is calculated using a modular shader framework, which facilitates the real-time visualization of the ablation zone in projected slice views and in volume rendering. The proposed methods are integrated in our software assistant prototype for planning RFA therapy. The software allows the physician to interactively place virtual RF applicator models. The real-time visualization of the corresponding approximated ablation zone facilitates interactive evaluation of the tumor coverage in order to optimize the applicator's placement such that all cancer cells are destroyed by the ablation.
While scientific visualization systems share many requirements with other graphical applications, they also have special requirements that make solutions based on standard rendering hardware or software not entirely satisfactory. Those requirements are illustrated by describing the renderer used in a production scientific visualization system, Data Explorer. The requirements for a visualization renderer are discussed. Implementation techniques used to meet the requirements of parallelism, volume rendering of irregular data, clipping, and integration of rendering modalities are described. The renderer described is a software renderer, but it is hoped that the requirements and implementation presented might influence the design of future generations of rendering hardware.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A prototype implementation of a splatting volume renderer (SVR) on a commercially available distributed memory MIMD (multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream) parallel processor, the nCUBE2, is described. Some relatively good rendering times can be achieved with the nCUBE SVR. Message-passing bottlenecks occur when large numbers of floating-point values have to be collected from every processor for every picture. For large images this is a severe limitation. An initial implementation of a SVR on a distributed memory parallel computer demonstrates the need for parallel computers with high-bandwidth connections between processors, and also for new parallelizable volume rendering algorithms.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Multiresolution analysis based on FWT (Fast Wavelet Transform) is now widely used in scientific visualization. Spherical biorthogonal wavelets for spherical triangular grids were introduced by P. Schroder and W. Sweldens (1995). In order to improve on the orthogonality of the wavelets, the concept of nearly orthogonality, and two new piecewise-constant (Haar) bases were introduced by G.M. Nielson (1997). We extend the results of Nielson. First we give two one-parameter families of triangular Haar wavelet bases that are nearly orthogonal in the sense of Nielson. Then we introduce a measure of orthogonality. This measure vanishes for orthogonal bases. Eventually, we show that we can find an optimal parameter of our wavelet families, for which the measure of orthogonality is minimized. Several numerical and visual examples for a spherical topographic data set illustrates our results.
We present a novel hardware-accelerated texture advection algorithm to visualize the motion of two-dimensional unsteady flows. Making use of several proposed extensions to the OpenGL-1.2 specification, we demonstrate animations of over 65,000 particles at 2 frames/sec on an SGI Octane with EMXI graphics. High image quality is achieved by careful attention to edge effects, noise frequency, and image enhancement. We provide a detailed description of the hardware implementation, including temporal and spatial coherence techniques, dye advection techniques, and feature extraction.
The concept of fairing applied to irregular triangular meshes has become more and more important. Previous contributions constructed better fairing operators, and applied them both to multiresolution editing tools and to multiresolution representations of meshes. The authors generalize these powerful techniques to handle non-manifold models. Our framework computes a multilevel fairing of models by fairing both the two-manifold surfaces that define the model, the so-called two-features, and all the boundary and intersection curves of the model, the so-called one-features. In addition we introduce two extensions that can be used in our framework as well as in manifold fairing concepts: an exact local volume preservation strategy and a method for feature preservation. Our framework works with any of the manifold fairing operators for meshes.
We introduce Light Collages - a lighting design system for effective visualization based on principles of human perception. Artists and illustrators enhance perception of features with lighting that is locally consistent and globally inconsistent. Inspired by these techniques, we design the placement of light sources to convey a greater sense of realism and better perception of shape with globally inconsistent lighting. Our algorithm segments the objects into local surface patches and uses a number of perceptual heuristics, such as highlights, shadows, and silhouettes, to enhance the perception of shape. We show our results on scientific and sculptured datasets.
Sort-last parallel rendering is an efficient technique to visualize huge datasets on COTS clusters. The dataset is subdivided and distributed across the cluster nodes. For every frame, each node renders a full resolution image of its data using its local GPU, and the images are composited together using a parallel image compositing algorithm. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of standard sort-last parallel rendering methods and of the different improvements proposed in the literature. This evaluation is based on a detailed analysis of the different hardware and software components. We present a new implementation of sort-last rendering that fully overlaps CPU(s), GPU and network usage all along the algorithm. We present experiments on a 3 years old 32-node PC cluster and on a 1.5 years old 5-node PC cluster, both with Gigabit interconnect, showing volume rendering at respectively 13 and 31 frames per second and polygon rendering at respectively 8 and 17 frames per second on a 1024 x 768 render area, and we show that our implementation outperforms or equals many other implementations and specialized visualization clusters.
Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a helpful addition to laborious visual inspection for preselection of suspected colonic polyps in virtual colonoscopy. Most of the previous work on automatic polyp detection makes use of indicators based on the scalar curvature of the colon wall and can result in many false-positive detections. Our work tries to reduce the number of false-positive detections in the preselection of polyp candidates. Polyp surface shape can be characterized and visualized using lines of curvature. In this paper, we describe techniques for generating and rendering lines of curvature on surfaces and we show that these lines can be used as part of a polyp detection approach. We have adapted existing approaches on explicit triangular surface meshes, and developed a new algorithm on implicit surfaces embedded in 3D volume data. The visualization of shaded colonic surfaces can be enhanced by rendering the derived lines of curvature on these surfaces. Features strongly correlated with true-positive detections were calculated on lines of curvature and used for the polyp candidate selection. We studied the performance of these features on 5 data sets that included 331 pre-detected candidates, of which 50 sites were true polyps. The winding angle had a significant discriminating power for true-positive detections, which was demonstrated by a Wilcoxon rank sum test with p&amp;lt;0.001. The median winding angle and inter-quartile range (IQR) for true polyps were 7.817 and 6.770-9.288 compared to 2.954 and 1.995-3.749 for false-positive detections
We describe our visualization process for a particle-based simulation of the formation of the first stars and their impact on cosmic history. The dataset consists of several hundred time-steps of point simulation data, with each time-step containing approximately two million point particles. For each time-step, we interpolate the point data onto a regular grid using a method taken from the radiance estimate of photon mapping [21]. We import the resulting regular grid representation into ParaView [24], with which we extract isosurfaces across multiple variables. Our images provide insights into the evolution of the early universe, tracing the cosmic transition from an initially homogeneous state to one of increasing complexity. Specifically, our visualizations capture the build-up of regions of ionized gas around the first stars, their evolution, and their complex interactions with the surrounding matter. These observations will guide the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, the key astronomy mission of the next decade.
We present a method to extract and visualize vortices that originate from bounding walls of three-dimensional time- dependent flows. These vortices can be detected using their footprint on the boundary, which consists of critical points in the wall shear stress vector field. In order to follow these critical points and detect their transformations, affected regions of the surface are parameterized. Thus, an existing singularity tracking algorithm devised for planar settings can be applied. The trajectories of the singularities are used as a basis for seeding particles. This leads to a new type of streak line visualization, in which particles are released from a moving source. These generalized streak lines visualize the particles that are ejected from the wall. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on several transient fluid flow datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.
This paper presents a scalable framework for real-time raycasting of large unstructured volumes that employs a hybrid bricking approach. It adaptively combines original unstructured bricks in important (focus) regions, with structured bricks that are resampled on demand in less important (context) regions. The basis of this focus+context approach is interactive specification of a scalar degree of interest (DOI) function. Thus, rendering always considers two volumes simultaneously: a scalar data volume, and the current DOI volume. The crucial problem of visibility sorting is solved by raycasting individual bricks and compositing in visibility order from front to back. In order to minimize visual errors at the grid boundary, it is always rendered accurately, even for resampled bricks. A variety of different rendering modes can be combined, including contour enhancement. A very important property of our approach is that it supports a variety of cell types natively, i.e., it is not constrained to tetrahedral grids, even when interpolation within cells is used. Moreover, our framework can handle multi-variate data, e.g., multiple scalar channels such as temperature or pressure, as well as time-dependent data. The combination of unstructured and structured bricks with different quality characteristics such as the type of interpolation or resampling resolution in conjunction with custom texture memory management yields a very scalable system.
Applying certain visualization techniques to datasets described on unstructured grids requires the interpolation of variables of interest at arbitrary locations within the dataset's domain of definition. Typical solutions to the problem of finding the grid element enclosing a given interpolation point make use of a variety of spatial subdivision schemes. However, existing solutions are memory- intensive, do not scale well to large grids, or do not work reliably on grids describing complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a data structure and associated construction algorithm for fast cell location in unstructured grids, and apply it to the interpolation problem. Based on the concept of bounding interval hierarchies, the proposed approach is memory-efficient, fast and numerically robust. We examine the performance characteristics of the proposed approach and compare it to existing approaches using a number of benchmark problems related to vector field visualization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully accommodate large datasets, and discuss application to visualization on both CPUs and GPUs.
The technique of placing directed line segments at grid points, known as hedgehogging, which has been used for visualizing 2D vector fields, is considered. A means of rapidly rendering a slice of a 3D field, suitable for a bilevel display, is provided. Shape and shadowing are used to disambiguate orientation. Liberal use of lookup tables makes the technique very fast.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Techniques for visualizing mathematical objects in four-dimensional (4D) space that exploit four-dimensional lighting effects are explored. The geometry of image production, stereography, and shadows in 4D is analyzed. Alternatives for smooth and specular shaded rendering of curves, surfaces, and solids in 4D are examined and a new approach that systematically converts curves or surfaces into uniquely renderable solids in 4D space by attaching spheres or circles to each point is proposed. Analogs of 3D shading methods are used to produce volume renderings that distinguish objects whose 3D projections from 4D are identical. Analyzing the procedures needed to justify and evaluate a system as this for teaching humans to 'see' in four dimensions leads to the proposal of a generally applicable four-step visualization paradigm.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Fast techniques for direct volume rendering over curvilinear grids (common to computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis) are developed. Three new projection methods that use polygon-rendering hardware for speed are presented and compared with each other and with previous methods for tetrahedral grids and rectilinear grids. A simplified algorithm for visibility ordering, based on a combination of breadth-first and depth-first searches, is described. A new multi-pass blending method is described that reduces visual artifacts that are introduced by linear interpolation in hardware where exponential interpolation is needed. Visualization tools that permit rapid data banding and cycling through transfer functions, as well as region restriction, are described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a novel presence acceleration for volumetric ray casting. A highly accurate estimation for object presence is obtained by projecting all grid cells associated with the object boundary on the image plane. Memory space and access time are reduced by run-length encoding of the boundary cells, while boundary cell projection time is reduced by exploiting projection templates and multiresolution volumes. Efforts have also been made towards a fast perspective projection as well as interactive classification. We further present task partitioning schemes for effective parallelization of both boundary cell projection and ray traversal procedures. Good load balancing has been reached by taking full advantage of both the optimizations in the serial rendering algorithm and shared-memory architecture. Our experimental results on a 16-processor SGI Power Challenge have shown interactive rendering rates for 256/sup 3/ volumetric data sets at 10-30 Hz. We describe the theory and implementation of our algorithm, and shows its superiority over the shear-warp factorization approach.
We present a new method for the modeling of freehand collected three-dimensional ultrasound data. The model is piecewise linear and based upon progressive tetrahedral domains created by a subdivision scheme which splits a tetrahedron on on its longest edge and guarantees a valid tetrahedrization. Least squares error is used to characterize the model and an effective iterative technique is used to compute the values of the model at the vertices of the tetrahedral grid. Since the subdivision strategy is adaptive, the complexity of the model conforms to the complexity of the data leading to an extremely efficient and highly compressed volume model. The model is evaluated in real time using piecewise linear interpolation, and gives a medical professional the chance to see images which would not be possible using conventional ultrasound techniques.
A new method for the simplification of flow fields is presented. It is based on continuous clustering. A well-known physical clustering model, the Cahn Hilliard model (J. Cahn and J. Hilliard, 1958), which describes phase separation, is modified to reflect the properties of the data to be visualized. Clusters are defined implicitly as connected components of the positivity set of a density function. An evolution equation for this function is obtained as a suitable gradient flow of an underlying anisotropic energy functional. Here, time serves as the scale parameter. The evolution is characterized by a successive coarsening of patterns: the actual clustering, and meanwhile the underlying simulation data specifies preferable pattern boundaries. The authors discuss the applicability of this new type of approach mainly for flow fields, where the cluster energy penalizes cross streamline boundaries, but the method also carries provisions in other fields as well. The clusters are visualized via iconic representations. A skeletonization algorithm is used to find suitable positions for the icons.
We describe a method to visualize the connectivity graph of a mesh using a natural embedding in 3D space. This uses a 3D shape representation that is based solely on mesh connectivity: the connectivity shape. Given a connectivity, we define its natural geometry as a smooth embedding in space with uniform edge lengths and describe efficient techniques to compute it. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that a surprising amount of geometric information is implicit in the connectivity. We also show how to generate connectivity shapes that approximate given 3D shapes. Potential applications of connectivity shapes to modeling and mesh coding are described.
Determining the three-dimensional structure of distant astronomical objects is a challenging task, given that terrestrial observations provide only one viewpoint. For this task, bipolar planetary nebulae are interesting objects of study because of their pronounced axial symmetry due to fundamental physical processes. Making use of this symmetry constraint, we present a technique to automatically recover the axisymmetric structure of bipolar planetary nebulae from two-dimensional images. With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows. In addition, the recovered spatial distribution of the emissive gas allows validating computer simulation results of the astrophysical formation processes of planetary nebulae.
We present a robust method for 3D reconstruction of closed surfaces from sparsely sampled parallel contours. A solution to this problem is especially important for medical segmentation, where manual contouring of 2D imaging scans is still extensively used. Our proposed method is based on a morphing process applied to neighboring contours that sweeps out a 3D surface. Our method is guaranteed to produce closed surfaces that exactly pass through the input contours, regardless of the topology of the reconstruction. Our general approach consecutively morphs between sets of input contours using an Eulerian formulation (i.e. fixed grid) augmented with Lagrangian particles (i.e. interface tracking). This is numerically accomplished by propagating the input contours as 2D level sets with carefully constructed continuous speed functions. Specifically this involves particle advection to estimate distances between the contours, monotonicity constrained spline interpolation to compute continuous speed functions without overshooting, and state-of-the-art numerical techniques for solving the level set equations. We demonstrate the robustness of our method on a variety of medical, topographic and synthetic data sets.
This paper describes a set of visual cues of contact designed to improve the interactive manipulation of virtual objects in industrial assembly/maintenance simulations. These visual cues display information of proximity, contact and effort between virtual objects when the user manipulates a part inside a digital mock-up. The set of visual cues encloses the apparition of glyphs (arrow, disk, or sphere) when the manipulated object is close or in contact with another part of the virtual environment. Light sources can also be added at the level of contact points. A filtering technique is proposed to decrease the number of glyphs displayed at the same time. Various effects - such as change in color, change in size, and deformation of shape - can be applied to the glyphs as a function of proximity with other objects or amplitude of the contact forces. A preliminary evaluation was conducted to gather the subjective preference of a group of participants during the simulation of an automotive assembly operation. The collected questionnaires showed that participants globally appreciated our visual cues of contact. The changes in color appeared to be preferred concerning the display of distances and proximity information. Size changes and deformation effects appeared to be preferred in terms of perception of contact forces between the parts. Last, light sources were selected to focus the attention of the user on the contact areas
A current research topic in molecular thermodynamics is the condensation of vapor to liquid and the investigation of this process at the molecular level. Condensation is found in many physical phenomena, e.g. the formation of atmospheric clouds or the processes inside steam turbines, where a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of condensation processes will help to optimize energy efficiency and avoid problems with droplets of macroscopic size. The key properties of these processes are the nucleation rate and the critical cluster size. For the calculation of these properties it is essential to make use of a meaningful definition of molecular clusters, which currently is a not completely resolved issue. In this paper a framework capable of interactively visualizing molecular datasets of such nucleation simulations is presented, with an emphasis on the detected molecular clusters. To check the quality of the results of the cluster detection, our framework introduces the concept of flow groups to highlight potential cluster evolution over time which is not detected by the employed algorithm. To confirm the findings of the visual analysis, we coupled the rendering view with a schematic view of the clusters' evolution. This allows to rapidly assess the quality of the molecular cluster detection algorithm and to identify locations in the simulation data in space as well as in time where the cluster detection fails. Thus, thermodynamics researchers can eliminate weaknesses in their cluster detection algorithms. Several examples for the effective and efficient usage of our tool are presented.
Direct volume rendering has become a popular method for visualizing volumetric datasets. Even though computers are continually getting faster, it remains a challenge to incorporate sophisticated illumination models into direct volume rendering while maintaining interactive frame rates. In this paper, we present a novel approach for advanced illumination in direct volume rendering based on GPU ray-casting. Our approach features directional soft shadows taking scattering into account, ambient occlusion and color bleeding effects while achieving very competitive frame rates. In particular, multiple dynamic lights and interactive transfer function changes are fully supported. Commonly, direct volume rendering is based on a very simplified discrete version of the original volume rendering integral, including the development of the original exponential extinction into a-blending. In contrast to a-blending forming a product when sampling along a ray, the original exponential extinction coefficient is an integral and its discretization a Riemann sum. The fact that it is a sum can cleverly be exploited to implement volume lighting effects, i.e. soft directional shadows, ambient occlusion and color bleeding. We will show how this can be achieved and how it can be implemented on the GPU.
MediaView is a computer program that provides a generic infrastructure for authoring and interacting with multimedia documents. Among its applications is the ability to furnish a user with a comprehensive environment for analysis and visualization. With this program the user can produce a document that contains mathematics, datasets and associated visualizations. From the dataset or embedded mathematics animated sequences can be produced in situ. Equations that appear in a document have a backing format that is compatible with the Mathematica language. Thus, by clicking on an equation, its semantics are conveyed to Mathematica, where the user can perform a variety of symbolic and numerical operations. Since the document is all digital, it can be shared on a local network or mailed electronically to a distant site. Animations and any other substructures of the document persist through the mailing process and can be awakened at the destination by the recipient.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A set of volume visualization tools that are based on the use of recursive ray tracing as the primary vehicle for realistic volume imaging is presented. The tools include shadows, mirrors, specularity, and constructive solid geometry. The underlying representation for the ray tracer is a 3-D raster of voxels that holds the discrete form of the scene. Unlike traditional volume rendering techniques, the discrete recursive ray tracer models many illumination phenomena by traversing discrete rays in voxel space. The approach provides true ray tracing of sampled or computed datasets, as well as ray tracing of hybrid scenes where sampled or computed data are intermixed with geometric models and enhances the understanding of complex biomedical datasets.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Various techniques are described for achieving interactive direct volume rendering of nonrectilinear data sets using fast projection (splatting) methods. The use of graphics hardware, rendering approximations, parallelization and reduced resolution meshes are discussed. Results from the use of these techniques are presented in the form of color photos and comparative timings.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A technique is given allowing interactive visualization of large, scalar, discrete volume fields as semitransparent clouds 'on the fly', i.e. without preprocessing. Interactivity is not restricted to geometric transformations, but includes all possible methods of processing the data. The system flexibly trades-off quality for performance at any desirable level. In particular, by using a scanline based method and a DDA-based traversing scheme instead of ray-tracing one achieves real-time processing during previewing. By means of the 'pyramidal volume' traversing technique, one achieves high-quality, constant-time filtering, independent of the data resolution. Several filters help to detect 'fuzzy', obscured hot spots, even within noisy data. The visualization pipeline allows the application of filters at four different stages, maximizing their flexibility. Four different illumination models have been implemented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Given (n-1)-dimensional parallel cross-sections of an n-dimensional body, one would like to reconstruct the n-dimensional body. The method based on Distance Field Interpolation (DFI) gives a robust solution to this problem in its ability to deal with any topology in any dimension. Still this method may give undesired solutions to the problem if the changes from one cross-section to the next are significant relative to the size of the details in the cross-sections. We consider the problem of solid reconstruction from contours, which can also be considered as a contour blending or contour morphing problem, where the third dimension is time. The method presented is based on interpolation of the distance field, guided by a warp function which is controlled by a set of corresponding anchor points. Some rules for defining a smooth least-distorting warp function are given. To reduce the distortion of the intermediate shapes, the warp function is decomposed into a rigid rotational part and an elastic part. The distance field interpolation method is modified so that the interpolation is guided by the warp function. The advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of blending between contours having different topological genus, and no correspondence between the geometric primitives should be established. The desired general correspondence is defined by the user in terms of a relatively small number of anchor points.
The paper introduces a tool for visualizing a multidimensional relevance space. Abstractly, the information to be displayed consists of a large number of objects, a set of features that are likely to be of interest to the user, and some function that measures the relevance level of every object to the various features. The goal is to provide the user with a concise and comprehensible visualization of that information. For the type of applications concentrated on, the exact relevance measures of the objects are not significant. This enables accuracy to be traded for a clearer display. The idea is to "flatten" the multidimensionality of the feature space into a 2D "relevance map", capturing the inter-relations among the features, without causing too many ambiguous interpretations of the results. To better reflect the nature of the data and to resolve the ambiguity the authors refine the given set of features and introduce the notion of composed features. The layout of the map is then obtained by grading it according to a set of rules and using a simulated annealing algorithm which optimizes the layout with respect to these rules. The technique proposed has been implemented and tested, in the context of visualizing the result of a Web search, in the RMAP (Relevance Map) prototype system.
We present a novel rendering technique, termed LOD-sprite rendering, which uses a combination of a level-of-detail (LOD) representation of the scene together with reusing image sprites (previously rendered images). Our primary application is accelerating terrain rendering. The LOD-sprite technique renders an initial frame using a high-resolution model of the scene geometry. It renders subsequent frames with a much lower-resolution model of the scene geometry and texture-maps each polygon with the image sprite from the initial high-resolution frame. As it renders these subsequent frames, the technique measures the error associated with the divergence of the view position from the position where the initial frame was rendered. Once this error exceeds a user-defined threshold, the technique re-renders the scene from the high-resolution model. We have efficiently implemented the LOD-sprite technique with texture mapping graphics hardware. Although to date we have only applied LOD-sprite to terrain rendering, it could easily be extended to other applications. We feel LOD-sprite holds particular promise for real time rendering systems.
Visualizing second-order 3D tensor fields continue to be a challenging task. Although there are several algorithms that have been presented, no single algorithm by itself is sufficient for the analysis because of the complex nature of tensor fields. In this paper, we present two new methods, based on volume deformation, to show the effects of the tensor field upon its underlying media. We focus on providing a continuous representation of the nature of the tensor fields. Each of these visualization algorithms is good at displaying some particular properties of the tensor field.
Vorticity is the quantity used to describe the creation, transformation and extinction of vortices. It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation. We used various techniques for the visualization of vorticity, including field lines and modified isosurfaces. For field line based visualization, we extended the image-guided streamline placement algorithm of Turk and Banks to data-guided field line placement on three-dimensional unstructured grids.
We propose a distributed data management scheme for large data visualization that emphasizes efficient data sharing and access. To minimize data access time and support users with a variety of local computing capabilities, we introduce an adaptive data selection method based on an "enhanced time-space partitioning" (ETSP) tree that assists with effective visibility culling, as well as multiresolution data selection. By traversing the tree, our data management algorithm can quickly identify the visible regions of data, and, for each region, adaptively choose the lowest resolution satisfying user-specified error tolerances. Only necessary data elements are accessed and sent to the visualization pipeline. To further address the issue of sharing large-scale data among geographically distributed collaborative teams, we have designed an infrastructure for integrating our data management technique with a distributed data storage system provided by logistical networking (LoN). Data sets at different resolutions are generated and uploaded to LoN for wide-area access. We describe a parallel volume rendering system that verifies the effectiveness of our data storage, selection and access scheme.
In this paper we investigate the effects of function composition in the form g(f(x)) = h(x) by means of a spectral analysis of h. We decompose the spectral description of h(x) into a scalar product of the spectral description of g(x) and a term that solely depends on f(x) and that is independent of g(x). We then use the method of stationary phase to derive the essential maximum frequency of g(f(x)) bounding the main portion of the energy of its spectrum. This limit is the product of the maximum frequency of g(x) and the maximum derivative of f(x). This leads to a proper sampling of the composition h of the two functions g and f. We apply our theoretical results to a fundamental open problem in volume rendering - the proper sampling of the rendering integral after the application of a transfer function. In particular, we demonstrate how the sampling criterion can be incorporated in adaptive ray integration, visualization with multi-dimensional transfer functions, and pre-integrated volume rendering
Histology is the study of the structure of biological tissue using microscopy techniques. As digital imaging technology advances, high resolution microscopy of large tissue volumes is becoming feasible; however, new interactive tools are needed to explore and analyze the enormous datasets. In this paper we present a visualization framework that specifically targets interactive examination of arbitrarily large image stacks. Our framework is built upon two core techniques: display-aware processing and GPU-accelerated texture compression. With display-aware processing, only the currently visible image tiles are fetched and aligned on-the-fly, reducing memory bandwidth and minimizing the need for time-consuming global pre-processing. Our novel texture compression scheme for GPUs is tailored for quick browsing of image stacks. We evaluate the usability of our viewer for two histology applications: digital pathology and visualization of neural structure at nanoscale-resolution in serial electron micrographs.
Multiple simulation runs using the same simulation model with different values of control parameters generate a large data set that captures the behavior of the modeled phenomenon. However, there is a conceptual and visual gap between the simulation model behavior and the data set that makes data analysis more difficult. We propose a simulation model view that helps to bridge that gap by visually combining the simulation model description and the generated data. The simulation model view provides a visual outline of the simulation process and the corresponding simulation model. The view is integrated in a Coordinated Multiple Views; (CMV) system. As the simulation model view provides a limited display space, we use three levels of details. We explored the use of the simulation model view, in close collaboration with a domain expert, to understand and tune an electronic unit injector (EUI). We also developed analysis procedures based on the view. The EUI is mostly used in heavy duty Diesel engines. We were mainly interested in understanding the model and how to tune it for three different operation modes: low emission, low consumption, and high power. Very positive feedback from the domain expert shows that the use of the simulation model view and the corresponding ;analysis procedures within a CMV system represents an effective technique for interactive visual analysis of multiple simulation runs.
We present TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling visualization system that couples a laser scanner, projector, and a flexible physical three-dimensional model with a standard geospatial information system (GIS) to create a tangible user interface for terrain data. TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.
Digital filtering is a crucial operation in volume reconstruction and visualization. Lowpass filters are needed for subsampling and minification. Interpolation filters are needed for registration and magnification, and to compensate for geometric distortions introduced by scanners. Interpolation filters are also needed in volume rendering for ray-casting and slicing. In this paper, we describe a method for digital filter design of interpolation filters based on weighted Chebyshev minimization. The accuracy of the resulting filters are compared with some commonly used filters defined by piecewise cubic polynomials. A significant finding of this paper is that although piecewise cubic interpolation has some computational advantages and may yield visually satisfactory results for some data, other data result in artifacts such as blurring. Furthermore, piecewise cubic filters are inferior for operations such as registration. Better results are obtained by the filters derived in this papers at only small increases in computation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a new method for creating n-dimensional rotation matrices from manipulating the projections of n-dimensional data coordinate axes onto a viewing plane. A user interface for n-dimensional rotation is implemented. The interface is shown to have no rotational hysteresis.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present new volume rendering techniques for efficiently generating high-quality stereoscopic images and propose criteria to evaluate stereo volume rendering algorithms. Specifically, we present fast stereo volume ray casting algorithms using segment composition and linearly-interpolated re-projection. A fast stereo shear-warp volume rendering algorithm is also presented and discussed.
Splatting is a popular direct volume rendering algorithm. However, the algorithm does not correctly render cases where the volume sampling rate is higher than the image sampling rate (e.g. more than one voxel maps into a pixel). This situation arises with orthographic projections of high-resolution volumes, as well as with perspective projections of volumes of any resolution. The result is potentially severe spatial and temporal aliasing artifacts. Some volume ray-casting algorithms avoid these artifacts by employing reconstruction kernels which vary in width as the rays diverge. Unlike ray-casting algorithms, existing splatting algorithms do not have an equivalent mechanism for avoiding these artifacts. The authors propose such a mechanism, which delivers high-quality splatted images and has the potential for a very efficient hardware implementation.
An interactive cerebral blood vessel exploration system is described. It has been designed on the basis of neurosurgeons' requirements in order to assist them in the diagnosis of vascular pathologies. The system is based on the construction of a symbolic model of the vascular tree, with automatic identification and labelling of vessel bifurcations, aneurysms and stenoses. It provides several types of visualization: individual MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) slices, MIP (maximum intensity projection), shaded rendering, symbolic schemes and surface reconstruction.
This paper describes by example a strategy for plotting and interacting with data in multiple metric spaces. The example system was designed for use with time-varying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data sets, but the methodology is directly applicable to other types of field data. The central objects embodied by the tool are portraits, which show the data in various coordinate systems, while preserving their spatial connectivity and temporal variability. The coordinates are derived in various ways from the field data, and an important feature is that new and derived portraits can be created interactively. The primary operations supported by the tool are brushing and linking: the user can select a subset of a given portrait, and this subset is highlighted in all portraits. The user can combine highlighted subsets from an arbitrary number of portraits with the usual logical operators, thereby indicating where an arbitrarily complex set of conditions holds. The system is useful for exploratory visualization and feature detection in multivariate data.
An application of C/sup 1/ scalar interpolation for 2D vector field topology visualization is presented. Powell-Sabin and Nielson interpolants are considered which both make use of Nielson's Minimum Norm Network for the precomputation of the derivatives in our implementation. A comparison of their results to the commonly used linear interpolant underlines their significant improvement of singularity location and topological skeleton depiction. Evaluation is based upon the processing of polynomial vector fields with known topology containing higher order singularities.
In this paper, we present a space efficient algorithm for speeding up isosurface extraction. Even though there exist algorithms that can achieve optimal search performance to identify isosurface cells, they prove impractical for large datasets due to a high storage overhead. With the dual goals of achieving fast isosurface extraction and simultaneously reducing the space requirement, we introduce an algorithm based on transform coding to compress the interval information of the cells in a dataset. Compression is achieved by first transforming the cell intervals (minima, maxima) into a form which allows more efficient compaction. It is followed by a dataset optimized non-uniform quantization stage. The compressed data is stored in a data structure that allows fast searches in the compression domain, thus eliminating the need to retrieve the original representation of the intervals at run-time. The space requirement of our search data structure is the mandatory cost of storing every cell ID once, plus an overhead for quantization information. The overhead is typically in the order of a few hundredths of the dataset size.
While there are a couple of transfer function design approaches for CT and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) data, direct volume rendering of ultrasound data still relies on manual adjustment of an inflexible piecewise linear opacity transfer function (OTF) on a trial-and-error basis. The main challenge of automatically designing an OTF for visualization of sonographic data is the low signal-to-noise ratio in combination with real time data acquisition at frame rates up to 25 volumes per second. In this paper, we present an efficient solution of this task. Our approach is based on the evaluation of tube cores, i.e., collections of voxels gathered by traversing the volume in rendering directions. We use information about the probable position of an interface between tissues of different echogenicity to adaptively design an OTF in a multiplicative way. We show the appropriateness of our approach by examples, deliberately on data sets of moderate quality arising frequently in clinical settings.
Modern object-oriented programs are hierarchical systems with many thousands of interrelated subsystems. Visualization helps developers to better comprehend these large and complex systems. This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships between the subsystems.
We describe a new dynamic level-of-detail (LOD) technique that allows real-time rendering of large tetrahedral meshes. Unlike approaches that require hierarchies of tetrahedra, our approach uses a subset of the faces that compose the mesh. No connectivity is used for these faces so our technique eliminates the need for topological information and hierarchical data structures. By operating on a simple set of triangular faces, our algorithm allows a robust and straightforward graphics hardware (GPU) implementation. Because the subset of faces processed can be constrained to arbitrary size, interactive rendering is possible for a wide range of data sets and hardware configurations.
Stars form in dense clouds of interstellar gas and dust. The residual dust surrounding a young star scatters and diffuses its light, making the star's "cocoon" of dust observable from Earth. The resulting structures, called reflection nebulae, are commonly very colorful in appearance due to wavelength-dependent effects in the scattering and extinction of light. The intricate interplay of scattering and extinction cause the color hues, brightness distributions, and the apparent shapes of such nebulae to vary greatly with viewpoint. We describe an interactive visualization tool for realistically rendering the appearance of arbitrary 3D dust distributions surrounding one or more illuminating stars. Our rendering algorithm is based on the physical models used in astrophysics research. The tool can be used to create virtual fly-throughs of reflection nebulae for interactive desktop visualizations, or to produce scientifically accurate animations for educational purposes, e.g., in planetarium shows. The algorithm is also applicable to investigate on-the-fly the visual effects of physical parameter variations, exploiting visualization technology to help gain a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the complex interaction of light and dust in real astrophysical settings.
Stackless traversal techniques are often used to circumvent memory bottlenecks by avoiding a stack and replacing return traversal with extra computation. This paper addresses whether the stackless traversal approaches are useful on newer hardware and technology (such as CUDA). To this end, we present a novel stackless approach for implicit kd-trees, which exploits the benefits of index-based node traversal, without incurring extra node visitation. This approach, which we term Kd-Jump, enables the traversal to immediately return to the next valid node, like a stack, without incurring extra node visitation (kd-restart). Also, Kd-Jump does not require global memory (stack) at all and only requires a small matrix in fast constant-memory. We report that Kd-Jump outperforms a stack by 10 to 20% and kd-restar t by 100%. We also present a Hybrid Kd-Jump, which utilizes a volume stepper for leaf testing and a run-time depth threshold to define where kd-tree traversal stops and volume-stepping occurs. By using both methods, we gain the benefits of empty space removal, fast texture-caching and realtime ability to determine the best threshold for current isosurface and view direction.
The increasing distinguishing capability of tomographic and other 3D scanners as well as the new voxelization algorithms place new demands on visualization techniques aimed at interactivity and rendition quality. Among others, triangulation on a subvoxel level based on the marching cube algorithm has gained popularity in recent years. However without graphics hardware support, rendering many small triangles could be awkward. We present a surface rendering approach based on ray tracing of segmented volumetric data. We show that if a proper interpolation scheme and voxel traversal algorithm are used, high quality images can be obtained within an acceptable time and without hardware support.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Many scientific and medical visualization techniques produce irregular surfaces whose shape and structure need to be understood. Examples include tissue and tumor boundaries in medical imaging, molecular surfaces and force thresholds in chemical and pharmaceutical applications, and isosurfaces in a wide range of 3D domains. The 3D shape of such surfaces can be particularly difficult to interpret because of the unfamiliar, irregular shapes, the potential concavities and bulges, and the lack of parallel lines and right angles to provide perspective depth cues. Attempts to display multiple irregular surfaces by making some or all of them transparent further complicates the problem. Texture can provide valuable cues to aid in the interpretation of irregular surfaces. Opacity-modulating textures offer a mechanism for the display of multiple surfaces without the extreme loss of clarity of multiple transparent surfaces. This paper presents a method for creating simple repeating textures and mapping them onto irregular surfaces.
Scaling of simulations challenges the effectiveness of conventional visualization methods. This problem becomes two-fold for mesoscale weather models that operate in near-real-time at cloud-scale resolution. For example, typical approaches to vector field visualization (e.g., wind) are based upon global methods, which may not illustrate detailed structure. In addition, such computations employ multi-resolution meshes to capture small-scale phenomena, which are not properly reflected in both vector and scalar realizations. To address the former critical point analysis and simple bandpass filtering of wind fields is employed for better seed point identification of streamline calculations. For the latter, an encapsulation of nested computational meshes is developed for general realization. It is then combined with the seed point calculation for an improved vector visualization of multi-resolution weather forecasting data.
Remote experience of sporting events has thus far been limited mostly to watching video and the scores and statistics associated with the sport. However, a fast-developing trend is the use of visualization techniques to give new insights into performance, style, and strategy of the players. Automated techniques can extract accurate information from video about player performance that not even the most skilled observer is able to discern. When presented as static images or as a three-dimensional virtual replay, this information makes viewing a game an entirely new and exciting experience. This paper presents one such sports visualization system called LucentVision, which has been developed for the sport of tennis. LucentVision uses real-time video analysis to obtain motion trajectories of players and the ball, and offers a rich set of visualization options based on this trajectory data. The system has been used extensively in the broadcast of international tennis tournaments, both on television and the Internet.
The bioactivity of a molecule strongly depends on its metastable conformational shapes and the transitions between these. Therefore, conformation analysis and visualization is a basic prerequisite for the understanding of biochemical processes. We present techniques for visual analysis of metastable molecular conformations. Core of these are flexibly applicable methods for alignment of molecular geometries, as well as methods for depicting shape and 'fuzziness' of metastable conformations. All analysis tools are provided in an integrated working environment. The described techniques are demonstrated with pharmaceutically active biomolecules.
We describe how to count the cases that arise in a family of visualization techniques, including marching cubes, sweeping simplices, contour meshing, interval volumes, and separating surfaces. Counting the cases is the first step toward developing a generic visualization algorithm to produce substitopes (geometric substitution of polytopes). We demonstrate the method using a software system ("GAP") for computational group theory. The case-counts are organized into a table that provides taxonomy of members of the family; numbers in the table are derived from actual lists of cases, which are computed by our methods. The calculation confirms previously reported case-counts for large dimensions that are too large to check by hand, and predicts the number of cases that will arise in algorithms that have not yet been invented.
In this paper a novel high-quality reconstruction scheme is presented. Although our method is mainly proposed to reconstruct volumetric data sampled on an optimal body-centered cubic (BCC) grid, it can be easily adapted lo the conventional regular rectilinear grid as well. The reconstruction process is decomposed into two steps. The first step, which is considered to be a preprocessing, is a discrete Gaussian deconvolution performed only once in the frequency domain. Afterwards, the second step is a spatial-domain convolution with a truncated Gaussian kernel, which is used to interpolate arbitrary samples for ray casting. Since the preprocessing is actually a discrete prefiltering, we call our technique prefiltered Gaussian reconstruction (PGR). It is shown that the impulse response of PGR well approximates the ideal reconstruction kernel. Therefore the quality of PGR is much higher than that of previous reconstruction techniques proposed for optimally sampled data, which are based on linear and cubic box splines adapted to the BCC grid. Concerning the performance, PGR is slower than linear box-spline reconstruction but significantly faster than cubic box-spline reconstruction.
Computational simulations frequently generate solutions defined over very large tetrahedral volume meshes containing many millions of elements. Furthermore, such solutions may often be expressed using non-linear basis functions. Certain solution techniques, such as discontinuous Galerkin methods, may even produce non-conforming meshes. Such data is difficult to visualize interactively, as it is far too large to fit in memory and many common data reduction techniques, such as mesh simplification, cannot be applied to non-conforming meshes. We introduce a point-based visualization system for interactive rendering of large, potentially non-conforming, tetrahedral meshes. We propose methods for adaptively sampling points from non-linear solution data and for decimating points at run time to fit GPU memory limits. Because these are streaming processes, memory consumption is independent of the input size. We also present an order-independent point rendering method that can efficiently render volumes on the order of 20 million tetrahedra at interactive rates
This paper presents a method for occlusion-free animation of geographical landmarks, and its application to a new type of car navigation system in which driving routes of interest are always visible. This is achieved by animating a nonperspective image where geographical landmarks such as mountain tops and roads are rendered as if they are seen from different viewpoints. The technical contribution of this paper lies in formulating the nonperspective terrain navigation as an inverse problem of continuously deforming a 3D terrain surface from the 2D screen arrangement of its associated geographical landmarks. The present approach provides a perceptually reasonable compromise between the navigation clarity and visual realism where the corresponding nonperspective view is fully augmented by assigning appropriate textures and shading effects to the terrain surface according to its geometry. An eye tracking experiment is conducted to prove that the present approach actually exhibits visually-pleasing navigation frames while users can clearly recognize the shape of the driving route without occlusion, together with the spatial configuration of geographical landmarks in its neighborhood
Accurately representing higher-order singularities of vector fields defined on piecewise linear surfaces is a non-trivial problem. In this work, we introduce a concise yet complete interpolation scheme of vector fields on arbitrary triangulated surfaces. The scheme enables arbitrary singularities to be represented at vertices. The representation can be considered as a facet-based "encoding" of vector fields on piecewise linear surfaces. The vector field is described in polar coordinates over each facet, with a facet edge being chosen as the reference to define the angle. An integer called the period jump is associated to each edge of the triangulation to remove the ambiguity when interpolating the direction of the vector field between two facets that share an edge. To interpolate the vector field, we first linearly interpolate the angle of rotation of the vectors along the edges of the facet graph. Then, we use a variant of Nielson's side-vertex scheme to interpolate the vector field over the entire surface. With our representation, we remove the bound imposed on the complexity of singularities that a vertex can represent by its connectivity. This bound is a limitation generally exists in vertex-based linear schemes. Furthermore, using our data structure, the index of a vertex of a vector field can be combinatorily determined
We describe a novel volumetric global illumination framework based on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. An FCC lattice has important advantages over a Cartesian lattice. It has higher packing density in the frequency domain, which translates to better sampling efficiency. Furthermore, it has the maximal possible kissing number (equivalent to the number of nearest neighbors of each site), which provides optimal 3D angular discretization among all lattices. We employ a new two-pass (illumination and rendering) global illumination scheme on an FCC lattice. This scheme exploits the angular discretization to greatly simplify the computation in multiple scattering and to minimize illumination information storage. The GPU has been utilized to further accelerate the rendering stage. We demonstrate our new framework with participating media and volume rendering with multiple scattering, where both are significantly faster than traditional techniques with comparable quality.
Better understanding of hemodynamics conceivably leads to improved diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, an elaborate analysis of the blood-flow in heart and thoracic arteries is essential. Contemporary MRI techniques enable acquisition of quantitative time-resolved flow information, resulting in 4D velocity fields that capture the blood-flow behavior. Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood-flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches. We demonstrate illustration-inspired particles, integral lines and integral surfaces, conveying distinct characteristics of the unsteady blood-flow. Lastly, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, valuing the practical use of our probe and flow visualization techniques.
The combination of volume data acquired by multiple modalities has been recognized as an important but challenging task. Modalities often differ in the structures they can delineate and their joint information can be used to extend the classification space. However, they frequently exhibit differing types of artifacts which makes the process of exploiting the additional information non-trivial. In this paper, we present a framework based on an information-theoretic measure of isosurface similarity between different modalities to overcome these problems. The resulting similarity space provides a concise overview of the differences between the two modalities, and also serves as the basis for an improved selection of features. Multimodal classification is expressed in terms of similarities and dissimilarities between the isosurfaces of individual modalities, instead of data value combinations. We demonstrate that our approach can be used to robustly extract features in applications such as dual energy computed tomography of parts in industrial manufacturing.
A voxel-based, forward projection algorithm with a pipeline architecture for real-time applications is presented. The multisensor capabilities (electrooptical, or visual, and infrared) currently implemented in software have also been applied to non-real-time imaging applications on workstations and minicomputers. Most suited for terrain-based applications, the system features haze, imbedded targets, moving objects, smooth shading, and specular reflections.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A method of lossless compression using wavelets is presented that enables progressive transmission of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data in PLOT3D format. The floating point data is first converted to double-precision floating point format to maintain adequate precision throughout the transform process. It is then transformed using Haar wavelets-four times in two spatial dimensions, twice in the third spatial dimension, and twice in time for a total compression factor of 64 times. The double precision format will maintain enough precision during the transform to keep the process lossless. Next, the transformed data is compressed using Huffman coding and transmitted progressively using spectral selection. This allows most of the information to be transmitted in the first pass. Details are transmitted in later passes which ultimately provide for lossless reconstruction of the original data.
This paper introduces an algorithm for rapid progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes: TetFusion. We describe how a simple geometry decimation operation steers a rapid and controlled progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes, while also taking care of complex mesh-inconsistency problems. The algorithm features a high decimation ratio per step, and inherently discourages any cases of self-intersection of boundary, element-boundary intersection at concave boundary-regions, and negative volume tetrahedra (flipping). We achieved rigorous reduction ratios of up to 98% for meshes consisting of 827,904 elements in less than 2 minutes, progressing through a series of level-of-details (LoDs) of the mesh in a controlled manner. We describe how the approach supports a balanced re-distribution of space between tetrahedral elements, and explain some useful control parameters that make it faster and more intuitive than 'edge collapse'-based decimation methods for volumetric meshes. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be employed for rapid LoD prototyping of large time-varying datasets as an aid to interactive visualization.
We present a system for simulating and visualizing the propagation of dispersive contaminants with an application to urban security. In particular, we simulate airborne contaminant propagation in open environments characterised by sky-scrapers and deep urban canyons. Our approach is based on the multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann model (MRTLBM), which can efficiently handle complex boundary conditions such as buildings. In addition, we model thermal effects on the flow field using the hybrid thermal MRTLBM. Our approach can also accommodate readings from various sensors distributed in the environment and adapt the simulation accordingly. We accelerate the computation and efficiently render many buildings with small textures on the GPU. We render streamlines and the contaminant smoke with self-shadowing composited with the textured buildings.
This paper formalizes a novel, intrinsic geometric scale space (IGSS) of 3D surface shapes. The intrinsic geometry of a surface is diffused by means of the Ricci flow for the generation of a geometric scale space. We rigorously prove that this multiscale shape representation satisfies the axiomatic causality property. Within the theoretical framework, we further present a feature-based shape representation derived from IGSS processing, which is shown to be theoretically plausible and practically effective. By integrating the concept of scale-dependent saliency into the shape description, this representation is not only highly descriptive of the local structures, but also exhibits several desired characteristics of global shape representations, such as being compact, robust to noise and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through salient geometric feature detection and highly discriminative matching of 3D scans.
Conventional browsing of image collections use mechanisms such as thumbnails arranged on a regular grid or on a line, often mounted over a scrollable panel. However, this approach does not scale well with the size of the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by thumbnails and shown on the screen. Thumbnails are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, thumbnails are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger thumbnails) to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole. During the entire process, temporal coherence is always maintained. GPU implementation easily guarantees the frame rates needed for fully smooth interactivity.
Sparse, irregular sampling is becoming a necessity for reconstructing large and high-dimensional signals. However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods - a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time. We describe the implications of our work in the analysis and visualization of scalar functions, and provide general strategies for computing and applying our neighborhood graphs towards robust data analysis.
In this paper, we describe a database query system that provides visual relevance feedback in querying large databases. The goal of our system is to support the query specification process by using each pixel of the display to represent one data item of the database. By arranging and coloring the pixels according to their relevance for the query, the user gets a visual impression of the resulting data set. Using sliders for each condition of the query, the user may change the query dynamically and receives immediate feedback by the visual representation of the resulting data set. By using multiple windows for different parts of a complex query, the user gets visual feedback for each part of the query and, therefore, will easier understand the overall result. The system may be used to query any database that contains tens of thousands to millions of data items, but it is especially helpful to explore large data sets with an unknown distribution of values and to find the interesting hot spots in huge amounts of data. The direct feedback allows to visually display the influence of incremental query refinements and, therefore, allows a better, easier and faster query specification.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a system for interactive explorations of extra- and intracranial blood vessels. Starting with a stack of images from 3D angiography, we use virtual clips to limit the segmentation of the vessel tree to the parts the neuroradiologists are interested in. Furthermore, methods of interactive virtual endoscopy are applied in order to provide an interior view of the blood vessels.
We present the problem of visualizing time-varying medical data. Two medical imaging modalities are compared-MRI and dynamic SPECT. For each modality, we examine several derived scalar and vector quantities such as the change in intensity over time, the spatial gradient, and the change of the gradient over time. We compare several methods for presenting the data, including isosurfaces, direct volume rendering, and vector visualization using glyphs. These techniques may provide more information and context than methods currently used in practice; thus it is easier to discover temporal changes and abnormalities in a data set.
Endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, applied to remove various kinds of pituitary tumors. To reduce the risk associated with this treatment, the surgeon must be skilled and well-prepared. Virtual endoscopy can be beneficial as a tool for training, preoperative planning and intraoperative support. This work introduces STEPS, a virtual endoscopy system designed to aid surgeons in getting acquainted with the endoscopic view, the handling of instruments, the transsphenoidal approach and challenges associated with the procedure. STEPS also assists experienced surgeons in planning a real endoscopic intervention by getting familiar with the individual patient anatomy, identifying landmarks, planning the approach and deciding upon the ideal target position of the actual surgical activity. Besides interactive visualization using two different first-hit ray casting techniques, the application provides navigation and perception aids and the possibility to simulate the procedure, including haptic feedback and simulation of surgical instruments.
Tensor topology is useful in providing a simplified and yet detailed representation of a tensor field. Recently the field of 3D tensor topology is advanced by the discovery that degenerate tensors usually form lines in their most basic configurations. These lines form the backbone for further topological analysis. A number of ways for extracting and tracing the degenerate tensor lines have also been proposed. In this paper, we complete the previous work by studying the behavior and extracting the separating surfaces emanating from these degenerate lines. First, we show that analysis of eigenvectors around a 3D degenerate tensor can be reduced to 2D. That is, in most instances, the 3D separating surfaces are just the trajectory of the individual 2D separatrices which includes trisectors and wedges. But the proof is by no means trivial since it is closely related to perturbation theory around a pair of singular slate. Such analysis naturally breaks down at the tangential points where the degenerate lines pass through the plane spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the repeated eigenvalues. Second, we show that the separatrices along a degenerate line may switch types (e.g. trisectors to wedges) exactly at the points where the eigenplane is tangential to the degenerate curve. This property leads to interesting and yet complicated configuration of surfaces around such transition points. Finally, we apply the technique to several common data sets to verify its correctness.
Scientific illustrations use accepted conventions and methodologies to effectively convey object properties and improve our understanding. We present a method to illustrate volume datasets by emulating example illustrations. As with technical illustrations, our volume illustrations more clearly delineate objects, enrich details, and artistically visualize volume datasets. For both color and scalar 3D volumes, we have developed an automatic color transfer method based on the clustering and similarities in the example illustrations and volume sources. As an extension to 2D Wang tiles, we provide a new, general texture synthesis method for Wang cubes that solves the edge discontinuity problem. We have developed a 2D illustrative slice viewer and a GPU-based direct volume rendering system that uses these non-periodic 3D textures to generate illustrative results similar to the 2D examples. Both applications simulate scientific illustrations to provide more information than the original data and visualize objects more effectively, while only requiring simple user interaction.
New product development involves people with different backgrounds. Designers, engineers, and consumers all have different design criteria, and these criteria interact. Early concepts evolve in this kind of collaborative context, and there is a need for dynamic visualization of the interaction between design shape and other shape-related design criteria. In this paper, a morphable model is defined from simplified representations of suitably chosen real cars, providing a continuous shape space to navigate, manipulate and visualize. Physical properties and consumer-provided scores for the real cars (such as 'weight' and 'sportiness') are estimated for new designs across the shape space. This coupling allows one to manipulate the shape directly while reviewing the impact on estimated criteria, or conversely, to manipulate the criterial values of the current design to produce a new shape with more desirable attributes.
In this paper, we present a visualization system for the visual analysis of PET/CT scans of aortic arches of mice. The system has been designed in close collaboration between researchers from the areas of visualization and molecular imaging with the objective to get deeper insights into the structural and molecular processes which take place during plaque development. Understanding the development of plaques might lead to a better and earlier diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, which are still the main cause of death in the western world. After motivating our approach, we will briefly describe the multimodal data acquisition process before explaining the visualization techniques used. The main goal is to develop a system which supports visual comparison of the data of different species. Therefore, we have chosen a linked multi-view approach, which amongst others integrates a specialized straightened multipath curved planar reformation and a multimodal vessel flattening technique. We have applied the visualization concepts to multiple data sets, and we will present the results of this investigation.
In the development of magnetic confinement fusion which will potentially be a future source for low cost power, physicists must be able to analyze the magnetic field that confines the burning plasma. While the magnetic field can be described as a vector field, traditional techniques for analyzing the field's topology cannot be used because of its Hamiltonian nature. In this paper we describe a technique developed as a collaboration between physicists and computer scientists that determines the topology of a toroidal magnetic field using fieldlines with near minimal lengths. More specifically, we analyze the Poincaré map of the sampled fieldlines in a Poincaré section including identifying critical points and other topological features of interest to physicists. The technique has been deployed into an interactiveparallel visualization tool which physicists are using to gain new insight into simulations of magnetically confined burning plasmas.
The field of visualization has addressed navigation of very large datasets, usually meshes and volumes. Significantly less attention has been devoted to the issues surrounding navigation of very large images. In the last few years the explosive growth in the resolution of camera sensors and robotic image acquisition techniques has widened the gap between the display and image resolutions to three orders of magnitude or more. This paper presents the first steps towards navigation of very large images, particularly landscape images, from an interactive visualization perspective. The grand challenge in navigation of very large images is identifying regions of potential interest. In this paper we outline a three-step approach. In the first step we use multi-scale saliency to narrow down the potential areas of interest. In the second step we outline a method based on statistical signatures to further cull out regions of high conformity. In the final step we allow a user to interactively identify the exceptional regions of high interest that merit further attention. We show that our approach of progressive elicitation is fast and allows rapid identification of regions of interest. Unlike previous work in this area, our approach is scalable and computationally reasonable on very large images. We validate the results of our approach by comparing them to user-tagged regions of interest on several very large landscape images from the Internet.
The authors have achieved rates as high as 15 frames per second for interactive direct visualization of 3D data by trading some function for speed, while volume rendering with a full complement of ramp classification capabilities is performed at 1.4 frames per second. These speeds have made the combination of region selection with volume rendering practical for the first time. Semantic-driven selection, rather than geometric clipping, has proved to be a natural means of interacting with 3D data. Internal organs in medical data or other regions of interest can be built from preprocessed region primitives. The resulting combined system has been applied to real 3D medical data with encouraging results.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An implementation of a virtual environment for visualizing the geometry of curved spacetime by the display of interactive geodesics is described. This technique displays the paths of particles under the influence of gravity as described by the general theory of relativity and is useful in the investigation of solutions to the field equations of that theory. A boom-mounted six-degree-of-freedom head-position-sensitive stereo CRT system is used for display. A hand-position-sensitive glove controller is used to control the initial positions and directions of geodesics in spacetime. A multiprocessor graphics workstation is used for computation and rendering. Several techniques for visualizing the geometry of spacetime using geodesics are discussed. Although this work is described exclusively in the context of physical four-dimensional spacetimes, it extends to arbitrary geometries in arbitrary dimensions. While this work is intended for researchers, it is also useful for the teaching of general relativity.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Interactive visualization systems provide a powerful means to explore complex data, especially when coupled with 3-D interaction and display devices to produce virtual worlds. While designing a quality static 2-D visualization is already a difficult task for most users, designing an interactive 3-D one is even more challenging. To address this problem, AutoVisual, a research system that designs interactive virtual worlds for visualizing and exploring multivariate relations of arbitrary arity, is being developed. AutoVisual uses worlds within worlds, an interactive visualization technique that exploits nested, heterogeneous coordinate systems to map multiple variables onto each spatial dimension. AutoVisual's designs are guided by user-specified visualization tasks, and by a catalog of design principles encoded using a rule-based language.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
VISAGE, a scientific visualization system implemented in an object-oriented, message passing environment, is described. The system includes over 500 classes ranging from visualization and graphics to Xlib and Motif user interface. Objects are created using compiled C and interact through an interpreted scripting language. The result is a flexible yet efficient system that has found wide application. The object architecture, the major issues faced when designing the visualization classes, and sample applications are also described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A technique is given for computer visualization of simultaneous three-dimensional vector and scalar fields such as velocity and temperature in reacting fluid flow fields. The technique, which is called Virtual Smoke, simulates the use of colored smoke for experimental gaseous fluid flow visualization. However, it is noninvasive and can animate, in particular, the dynamic behaviors of steady-state or instantaneous flow fields obtained from numerical simulations. Virtual Smoke is based on volume seeds and volume seedlings, which are direct volume visualization methods previously developed for highly interactive scalar volume data exploration. Data from combustion simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of Virtual Smoke.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper describes three alternative volume rendering approaches to visualizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. One new approach uses realistic volumetric gas rendering techniques to produce photo-realistic images and animations from scalar CFD data. The second uses ray casting that is based an a sampler illumination model and is mainly centered around a versatile new tool for the design of transfer functions. The third method employs a simple illumination model and rapid rendering mechanisms to provide efficient preview capabilities. These tools provide a large range of volume rendering capabilities to be used by the CFD explorer to render rapidly for navigation through the data, to emphasize data features (e.g., shock waves) with a specific transfer function, or to present a realistic rendition of the model.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper considers how out-of-core visualization applies to terrain datasets, which are among the largest now presented for interactive visualization and can range to sizes of 20 GB and more. It is found that a combination of out-of-core visualization, which tends to focus on 3D data, and visual simulation, which places an emphasis on visual perception and real-time display of multiresolution data, results in interactive terrain visualization with significantly improved data access and quality of presentation. Further, the visual simulation approach provides qualities that are useful for general data, not just terrain.
Very large irregular-grid data sets are represented as tetrahedral meshes and may incur significant disk I/O access overhead in the rendering process. An effective way to alleviate the disk I/O overhead associated with rendering a large tetrahedral mesh is to reduce the I/O bandwidth requirement through compression. Existing tetrahedral mesh compression algorithms focus only on compression efficiency and cannot be readily integrated into the mesh rendering process, and thus demand that a compressed tetrahedral mesh be decompressed before it can be rendered into a 2D image. This paper presents an integrated tetrahedral mesh compression and rendering algorithm called Gatun, which allows compressed tetrahedral meshes to be rendered incrementally as they are being decompressed, thus leading to an efficient irregular grid rendering pipeline. Both compression and rendering algorithms in Gatun exploit the same local connectivity information among adjacent tetrahedra, and thus can be tightly integrated into a unified implementation framework. Our tetrahedral compression algorithm is specifically designed to facilitate the integration with an irregular grid renderer without any compromise in compression efficiency. A unique performance advantage of Gatun is its ability to reduce the runtime memory footprint requirement by releasing memory allocated to tetrahedra as early as possible.
We review several schemes for dividing cubical cells into simplices (tetrahedra) in 3-D for interpolating from sampled data to R/sup 3/ or for computing isosurfaces by barycentric interpolation. We present test data that reveal the geometric artifacts that these subdivision schemes generate, and discuss how these artifacts relate to the filter kernels that correspond to the subdivision schemes.
We present some new methods for computing estimates of normal vectors at the vertices of a triangular mesh surface approximation to an isosurface which has been computed by the marching cube algorithm. These estimates are required for the smooth rendering of triangular mesh surfaces. The conventional method of computing estimates based upon divided difference approximations of the gradient can lead to poor estimates in some applications. This is particularly true for isosurfaces obtained from a field function, which is defined only for values near to the isosurface. We describe some efficient methods for computing the topology of the triangular mesh surface, which is used for obtaining local estimates of the normals. In addition, a new, one pass, approach for these types of applications is described and compared to existing methods.
Recent activity within the UK National e-Science Programme has identified a need to establish an ontology for visualization. Motivation for this includes defining web and grid services for visualization (the ‘semantic grid’), supporting collaborative work, curation, and underpinning visualization research and education. At a preliminary meeting, members of the UK visualization community identified a skeleton for the ontology. We have started to build on this by identifying how existing work might be related and utilized. We believe that the greatest challenge is reaching a consensus within the visualization community itself. This poster is intended as one step in this process, setting out the perceived needs for the ontology, and sketching initial directions. It is hoped that this will lead to debate, feedback and involvement across the community.
Topological concepts and techniques have been broadly applied in computer graphics and geometric modeling. However, the homotopy type of a mapping between two surfaces has not been addressed before. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the problem of computing continuous maps with different homotopy types between two arbitrary triangle meshes with the same topology. Inspired by the rich theory of topology as well as the existing body of work on surface mapping, our newly-developed mapping techniques are both fundamental and unique, offering many attractive advantages. First, our method allows the user to change the homotopy type or global structure of the mapping with minimal intervention. Moreover, to locally affect shape correspondence, we articulate a new technique that robustly satisfies hard feature constraints, without the use of heuristics to ensure validity. In addition to acting as a useful tool for computer graphics applications, our method can be used as a rigorous and practical mechanism for the visualization of abstract topological concepts such as homotopy type of surface mappings, homology basis, fundamental domain, and universal covering space. At the core of our algorithm is a procedure for computing the canonical homology basis and using it as a common cut graph for any surface with the same topology. We demonstrate our results by applying our algorithm to shape morphing in this paper.
A new close range virtual reality system is introduced that allows intuitive and immersive user interaction with computer generated objects. A projector with a special spherical lens is combined with a flexible, tracked rear projection screen that users hold in their hands. Unlike normal projectors, the spherical lens allows for a 180 degree field of view and nearly infinite depth of focus. This allows the user to move the screen around the environment and use it as a virtual "slice" to examine the interior of 3D volumes. This provides a concrete correspondence between the virtual representation of the 3D volume and how that volume would actually appear if its real counterpart was sliced open. The screen can also be used as a "magic window" to view the mesh of the volume from different angles prior to taking cross sections of it. Real time rendering of the desired 3D volume or mesh is accomplished using current graphics hardware. Additional applications of the system are also discussed.
We present the first distributed paradigm for multiple users to interact simultaneously with large tiled rear projection display walls. Unlike earlier works, our paradigm allows easy scalability across different applications, interaction modalities, displays and users. The novelty of the design lies in its distributed nature allowing well-compartmented, application independent, and application specific modules. This enables adapting to different 2D applications and interaction modalities easily by changing a few application specific modules. We demonstrate four challenging 2D applications on a nine projector display to demonstrate the application scalability of our method: map visualization, virtual graffiti, virtual bulletin board and an emergency management system. We demonstrate the scalability of our method to multiple interaction modalities by showing both gesture-based and laser-based user interfaces. Finally, we improve earlier distributed methods to register multiple projectors. Previous works need multiple patterns to identify the neighbors, the configuration of the display and the registration across multiple projectors in logarithmic time with respect to the number of projectors in the display. We propose a new approach that achieves this using a single pattern based on specially augmented QR codes in constant time. Further, previous distributed registration algorithms are prone to large misregistrations. We propose a novel radially cascading geometric registration technique that yields significantly better accuracy. Thus, our improvements allow a significantly more efficient and accurate technique for distributed self-registration of multi-projector display walls.
A technique is presented for plotting large multivariate data sets that involves the mapping of n independent variable dimensions on to a single hierarchical horizontal axis with a single dependent variable being plotted on the vertical axis. The emphasis is on visual statistical analysis of either discrete variables or continuous variables that have been sampled on, or binned to, a regular n-dimensional lattice. The general applicability of the technique is discussed, and ways are explored of representing the hierarchical data-driven symbols that are particularly well suited to a variety of visual analysis tasks.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Scalar functions of three variables, w=f(x, y, z), are common in many types of scientific and medical applications. Such 3D scalar fields can be understood as elevation maps in four dimensions, with three independent variables (x, y, z) and a fourth, dependent, variable w that corresponds to the elevations. It is shown how techniques developed originally for the display of 3-manifolds in 4D Euclidean space can be adapted to visualize 3D scalar fields in a variety of ways.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We describe how techniques from computer graphics are used to visualize pool fire data and compute radiative effects from pool fires. The basic tools are ray casting and accurate line integration using the RADCAL program. Example images in the visible and infrared band are shown which are given of irradiation calculations and novel methods to visualize the results of irradiation calculations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Information visualization faces challenges presented by the need to represent abstract data and the relationships within the data. Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques. The combined technique of applying a time axis with a 3D scatter plot and query filters to visualization of biological sequence similarity data is both powerful and novel.
An isovalue contour of a function of two complex variables defines a surface in four-space. We present a robust technique for creating polygonal contours of complex-valued functions. The technique, contour meshing, generalizes well to larger dimensions.
Interpolating contours and reconstructing a rational surface from a contour map are two essential problems in terrain modeling. They are often met in the field of computer graphics and CAD systems based on geographic information systems. Although many approaches have been developed for these two problems, one difficulty still remains. That is how to ensure that the reconstructed surface is both smooth globally and coincides with the given contours exactly simultaneously. In this paper we solve the two problems in a unified framework. We use gradient controlled partial differential equation (PDE) surfaces to express terrain surfaces, in which the surface shapes can be globally determined by the contours, their locations, height and gradient values. The surface generated by this method is accurate in the sense of exactly coinciding with the original contours and smooth with C/sup 1/ continuity everywhere. The method can reveal smooth saddle shapes caused by surface branching of one to more and can make rational interpolated sub-contours between two or more neighboring contours.
We present an immersive system for exploring numerically simulated flow data through a model of a coronary artery graft. This tightly-coupled interdisciplinary project is aimed at understanding how to reduce the failure rate of these grafts. The visualization system provides a mechanism for exploring the effect of changes to the geometry, to the flow, and for exploring potential sources of future lesions. The system uses gestural and voice interactions exclusively, moving away from more traditional windows/icons/menus/point-and-click (WIMP) interfaces. We present an example session using the system and discuss our experiences developing, testing, and using it. We describe some of the interaction and rendering techniques that we experimented with and describe their level of success. Our experience suggests that systems like this are exciting to clinical researchers, but conclusive evidence of their value is not yet available.
Since the original paper of Lacroute and Levoy (1994), where the shear-warp factorization was also shown for perspective projections, a lot of work has been carried out using the shear-warp factorization with parallel projections. However, none of it has proved or improved the algorithm for the perspective projection. Also in Lacroute's Volpack library, the perspective shear-warp volume rendering algorithm is missing. This paper reports on an implementation of the perspective shear-warp algorithm, which includes enhancements for its application in immersive virtual environments. Furthermore, a mathematical proof for the correctness of the permutation of projection and warp is provided, so far a basic assumption of the shear-warp perspective projection.
We present the first algorithm that employs hardware-accelerated cell-projection for direct volume rendering of cyclic meshes, i.e., meshes with visibility cycles. The visibility sorting of a cyclic mesh is performed by an extended topological sorting, which computes and isolates visibility cycles. Measured sorting times are comparable to previously published algorithms, which are, however, restricted to acyclic meshes. In practice, our algorithm is also useful for acyclic meshes as numerical instabilities can lead to false visibility cycles. Our method includes a simple, hardware-assisted algorithm based on image compositing that renders visibility cycles correctly. For tetrahedral meshes this algorithm allows us to render each tetrahedral cell (whether it is part of a cycle or not) by hardware-accelerated cell-projection. In its basic form our method applies only to convex cyclic meshes; however, we present an exact and a simpler but inexact extension of our method for nonconvex meshes.
Simulations often generate large amounts of data that require use of SciVis techniques for effective exploration of simulation results. In some cases, like 1D theory of fluid dynamics, conventional SciVis techniques are not very useful. One such example is a simulation of injection systems that is becoming more and more important due to an increasingly restrictive emission regulations. There are many parameters and correlations among them that influence the simulation results. We describe how basic information visualization techniques can help in visualizing, understanding and analyzing this kind of data. The Com Vis tool is developed and used to analyze and explore the data. Com Vis supports multiple linked views and common information visualization displays such as 2D and 3D scatter-plot, histogram, parallel coordinates, pie-chart, etc. A diesel common rail injector with 2/2 way valve is used for a case study. Data sets were generated using a commercially available AVL HYDSIM simulation tool for dynamic analysis of hydraulic and hydro-mechanical systems, with the main application area in the simulation of fuel injection systems.
Thread-like structures are becoming more common in modern volumetric data sets as our ability to image vascular and neural tissue at higher resolutions improves. The thread-like structures of neurons and micro-vessels pose a unique problem in visualization since they tend to be densely packed in small volumes of tissue. This makes it difficult for an observer to interpret useful patterns from the data or trace individual fibers. In this paper we describe several methods for dealing with large amounts of thread-like data, such as data sets collected using knife-edge scanning microscopy (KESM) and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). These methods allow us to collect volumetric data from embedded samples of whole-brain tissue. The neuronal and microvascular data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions. Traditional visualization schemes are not sufficient to make sense of the large, dense, complex structures encountered. In this paper, we address three methods to allow a user to explore a fiber network effectively. We describe interactive techniques for rendering large sets of neurons using self-orienting surfaces implemented on the GPU. We also present techniques for rendering fiber networks in a way that provides useful information about flow and orientation. Third, a global illumination framework is used to create high-quality visualizations that emphasize the underlying fiber structure. Implementation details, performance, and advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed
Neurosurgical planning and image guided neurosurgery require the visualization of multimodal data obtained from various functional and structural image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), functional MRI, Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and so on. In the case of epilepsy neurosurgery for example, these images are used to identify brain regions to guide intracranial electrode implantation and resection. Generally, such data is visualized using 2D slices and in some cases using a 3D volume rendering along with the functional imaging results. Visualizing the activation region effectively by still preserving sufficient surrounding brain regions for context is exceedingly important to neurologists and surgeons. We present novel interaction techniques for visualization of multimodal data to facilitate improved exploration and planning for neurosurgery. We extended the line widget from VTK to allow surgeons to control the shape of the region of the brain that they can visually crop away during exploration and surgery. We allow simple spherical, cubical, ellipsoidal and cylindrical (probe aligned cuts) for exploration purposes. In addition we integrate the cropping tool with the image-guided navigation system used for epilepsy neurosurgery. We are currently investigating the use of these new tools in surgical planning and based on further feedback from our neurosurgeons we will integrate them into the setup used for image-guided neurosurgery.
The authors discuss the special properties of volumetric cell data (e.g., noise, discontinuity, raggedness) and the particular difficulties encountered when trying to visualize them in three dimensions. The authors describe some of the solutions adopted, specifically in surface discrimination and shading. Nerve cells (neuroblastoma) grown in tissue culture were selected as the biological preparation because these cells possess very rich actin structures. The cells were stained with a fluorescent probe specific for actin (rhodamine-phalloidin) and were viewed and optically sectioned using the Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal fluorescence microscope. The slice dataset was then reconstructed and processed in the BioCube environment, a comprehensive system developed for volume visualization of cellular structures. The actin cytoskeleton of single cells was visualized and manipulated using this system.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper discusses the problem of subdividing unstructured mesh topologies containing hexahedra, prisms, pyramids and tetrahedra into a consistent set of only tetrahedra, while preserving the overall mesh topology. Efficient algorithms for volume rendering, iso-contouring and particle advection exist for mesh topologies comprised solely of tetrahedra. General finite-element simulations however, consist mainly of hexahedra, and possibly prisms, pyramids and tetrahedra. Arbitrary subdivision of these mesh topologies into tetrahedra can lead to discontinuous behaviour across element faces. This will show up as visible artifacts in the iso-contouring and volume rendering algorithms, and lead to impossible face adjacency graphs for many algorithms. The authors present various properties of tetrahedral subdivisions, and an algorithm SOP determining a consistent subdivision containing a minimal set of tetrahedra.
We present a novel forward image mapping algorithm, which speeds up perspective warping, as in texture mapping. It processes the source image in a special scanline order instead of the normal raster scanline order. This special scanline has the property of preserving parallelism when projecting to the target image. The algorithm reduces the complexity of perspective-correct image warping by eliminating the division per pixel and replacing it with a division per scanline. The method also corrects the perspective distortion in Gouraud shading with negligible overhead. Furthermore, the special scanline order is suitable for antialiasing using a more accurate antialiasing conic filter, with minimum additional cost. The algorithm is highlighted by incremental calculations and optimized memory bandwidth by reading each source pixel only once, suggesting a potential hardware implementation.
Presents an efficient keyframeless image-based rendering technique. An intermediate image is used to exploit the coherences among neighboring frames. The pixels in the intermediate image are first rendered by a ray-casting method and then warped to the intermediate image at the current viewpoint and view direction. We use an offset buffer to record the precise positions of these pixels in the intermediate image. Every frame is generated in three steps: warping the intermediate image onto the frame, filling in holes, and selectively rendering a group of "old" pixels. By dynamically adjusting the number of those "old" pixels in the last step, the workload at every frame can be balanced. The pixels generated by the last two steps make contributions to the new intermediate image. Unlike occasional keyframes in conventional image-based rendering, which need to be totally re-rendered, intermediate images only need to be partially updated at every frame. In this way, we guarantee more stable frame rates and more uniform image qualities. The intermediate image can be warped efficiently by a modified incremental 3D warp algorithm. As a specific application, we demonstrate our technique with a voxel-based terrain rendering system.
We present a new algorithm for material boundary interface reconstruction from data sets containing volume fractions. We transform the reconstruction problem to a problem that analyzes the dual data set, where each vertex in the dual mesh has an associated barycentric coordinate tuple that represents the fraction of each material present. After constructing the dual tetrahedral mesh from the original mesh, we construct material boundaries by mapping a tetrahedron into barycentric space and calculating the intersections with Voronoi cells in barycentric space. These intersections are mapped back to the original physical space and triangulated to form the boundary surface approximation. This algorithm can be applied to any grid structure and can treat any number of materials per element/vertex.
Analysis of degenerate tensors is a fundamental step in finding the topological structures and separatrices in tensor fields. Previous work in this area have been limited to analyzing symmetric second order tensor fields. In this paper, we extend the topological analysis to 2D general (asymmetric) second order tensor fields. We show that it is not sufficient to define degeneracies based on eigenvalues alone, but one must also include the eigenvectors in the analysis. We also study the behavior of these eigenvectors as they cross from one topological region into another.
In this paper, we present a volume roaming system dedicated to oil and gas exploration. Our system combines probe-based volume rendering with data processing and computing. The daily oil production and the estimation of the world proven-reserves directly affect the barrel price and have a strong impact on the economy. Among others, production and correct estimation are linked to the accuracy of the sub-surface model used for predicting oil reservoirs shape and size. Geoscientists build this model from the interpretation of seismic data, i.e. 3D images of the subsurface obtained from geophysical surveys. Our system couples visualization and data processing for the interpretation of seismic data. It is based on volume roaming along with efficient volume paging to manipulate the multi-gigabyte data sets commonly acquired during seismic surveys. Our volume rendering lenses implement high quality pre-integrated volume rendering with accurate lighting. They use a generic multi-modal volume rendering system that blends several volumes in the spirit of the "stencil" paradigm used in 2D painting programs. In addition, our system can interactively display non-polygonal isosurfaces painted with an attribute. Beside the visualization algorithms, automatic extraction of local features of the subsurface model also take full advantage of the volume paging.
Visualization algorithms can have a large number of parameters, making the space of possible rendering results rather high-dimensional. Only a systematic analysis of the perceived quality can truly reveal the optimal setting for each such parameter. However, an exhaustive search in which all possible parameter permutations are presented to each user within a study group would be infeasible to conduct. Additional complications may result from possible parameter co-dependencies. Here, we will introduce an efficient user study design and analysis strategy that is geared to cope with this problem. The user feedback is fast and easy to obtain and does not require exhaustive parameter testing. To enable such a framework we have modified a preference measuring methodology, conjoint analysis, that originated in psychology and is now also widely used in market research. We demonstrate our framework by a study that measures the perceived quality in volume rendering within the context of large parameter spaces.
Representing bivariate scalar maps is a common but difficult visualization problem. One solution has been to use two dimensional color schemes, but the results are often hard to interpret and inaccurately read. An alternative is to use a color sequence for one variable and a texture sequence for another. This has been used, for example, in geology, but much less studied than the two dimensional color scheme, although theory suggests that it should lead to easier perceptual separation of information relating to the two variables. To make a texture sequence more clearly readable the concept of the quantitative texton sequence (QTonS) is introduced. A QTonS is defined a sequence of small graphical elements, called textons, where each texton represents a different numerical value and sets of textons can be densely displayed to produce visually differentiable textures. An experiment was carried out to compare two bivariate color coding schemes with two schemes using QTonS for one bivariate map component and a color sequence for the other. Two different key designs were investigated (a key being a sequence of colors or textures used in obtaining quantitative values from a map). The first design used two separate keys, one for each dimension, in order to measure how accurately subjects could independently estimate the underlying scalar variables. The second key design was two dimensional and intended to measure the overall integral accuracy that could be obtained. The results show that the accuracy is substantially higher for the QTonS/color sequence schemes. A hypothesis that texture/color sequence combinations are better for independent judgments of mapped quantities was supported. A second experiment probed the limits of spatial resolution for QTonSs.
Flows through tubular structures are common in many fields, including blood flow in medicine and tubular fluid flows in engineering. The analysis of such flows is often done with a strong reference to the main flow direction along the tubular boundary. In this paper we present an approach for straightening the visualization of tubular flow. By aligning the main reference direction of the flow, i.e., the center line of the bounding tubular structure, with one axis of the screen, we are able to natively juxtapose (1.) different visualizations of the same flow, either utilizing different flow visualization techniques, or by varying parameters of a chosen approach such as the choice of seeding locations for integration-based flow visualization, (2.) the different time steps of a time-dependent flow, (3.) different projections around the center line , and (4.) quantitative flow visualizations in immediate spatial relation to the more qualitative classical flow visualization. We describe how to utilize this approach for an informative interactive visual analysis. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by visualizing two datasets from two different fields: an arterial blood flow measurement and a tubular gas flow simulation from the automotive industry.
Presently, there are very few visualization systems available for time-dependent flow fields. Although existing visualization systems for instantaneous flow fields may be used to view time-dependent flow fields at discrete points in time, the time variable is usually not considered in the visualization technique. We present a simple and effective approach for visualizing time-dependent flow fields using streaklines. A system was developed to demonstrate this approach. The system can process many time frames of flow fields without requiring that all the data be in memory simultaneously, and it also handles flow fields with moving grids. We have used the system to visualize streaklines from several large 3-D time-dependent flow fields with moving grids. The system was able to provide useful insights to the physical phenomena in the flow fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We introduce an algorithm for reconstructing a solid model given a series of planar cross sections. The main contribution of this work is the use of knowledge obtained during the interpolation of neighboring layers while attempting to interpolate a particular layer. This knowledge is used to reconstruct a surface in which consecutive layers are connected smoothly. In most previous work, each layer is interpolated independently of what happened or will happen in the other layers. We also discuss various objective functions which aim to optimize the reconstruction, and present an evaluation of the different objective functions by using various criteria.
This paper presents techniques for interactively visualizing tensor fields using deformations. The conceptual idea behind this approach is to allow the tensor field to manifest its influence on idealized objects placed within the tensor field. This is similar, though not exactly the same, to surfaces deforming under load in order to relieve built up stress and strain. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Deviator-Isotropic tensor decomposition in deformation visualizations of CFD strain rate. We also investigate how directional flow techniques can be extended to distinguish between regions of tensile versus compressive forces.
We present an efficient algorithm to mesh the macromolecules surface model represented by the skin surface defined by Edelsbrunner. Our algorithm overcomes several challenges residing in current surface meshing methods. First, we guarantee the mesh quality with a provable lower bound of 21/spl deg/ on its minimum angle. Second, we ensure the triangulation is homeomorphic to the original surface. Third, we improve the efficiency of constructing the restricted Delaunay triangulation (RDT) of smooth surfaces. We achieve this by constructing the RDT using the advancing front method without computing the Delaunay tetrahedrization of the sample points on the surfaces. The difficulty of handling the front collision problem is tackled by employing the Morse theory. In particular, we construct the Morse-Smale complex to simplify the topological changes of the front. Our implementation results suggest that the algorithm decrease the time of generating high quality homeomorphic skin mesh from hours to a few minutes.
Although luminance contrast plays a predominant role in motion perception, significant additional effects are introduced by chromatic contrasts. In this paper, relevant results from psychophysical and physiological research are described to clarify the role of color in motion detection. Interpreting these psychophysical experiments, we propose guidelines for the design of animated visualizations, and a calibration procedure that improves the reliability of visual motion representation. The guidelines are applied to examples from texture-based flow visualization, as well as graph and tree visualisation.
In this article we propose a box spline and its variants for reconstructing volumetric data sampled on the Cartesian lattice. In particular we present a tri-variate box spline reconstruction kernel that is superior to tensor product reconstruction schemes in terms of recovering the proper Cartesian spectrum of the underlying function. This box spline produces a C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reconstruction that can be considered as a three dimensional extension of the well known Zwart-Powell element in 2D. While its smoothness and approximation power are equivalent to those of the tri-cubic B-spline, we illustrate the superiority of this reconstruction on functions sampled on the Cartesian lattice and contrast it to tensor product B-splines. Our construction is validated through a Fourier domain analysis of the reconstruction behavior of this box spline. Moreover, we present a stable method for evaluation of this box spline by means of a decomposition. Through a convolution, this decomposition reduces the problem to evaluation of a four directional box spline that we previously published in its explicit closed form
A contour tree is a powerful tool for delineating the topological evolution of isosurfaces of a single-valued function, and thus has been frequently used as a means of extracting features from volumes and their time-varying behaviors. Several sophisticated algorithms have been proposed for constructing contour trees while they often complicate the software implementation especially for higher-dimensional cases such as time-varying volumes. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to plotting in 3D space, approximate contour trees from a set of scattered samples embedded in the high-dimensional space. Our main idea is to take advantage of manifold learning so that we can elongate the distribution of high-dimensional data samples to embed it into a low-dimensional space while respecting its local proximity of sample points. The contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of new distance metrics to manifold learning, which allows us to reformulate existing algorithms as a variant of currently available dimensionality reduction scheme. Efficient reduction of data sizes together with segmentation capability is also developed to equip our approach with a coarse-to-fine analysis even for large-scale datasets. Examples are provided to demonstrate that our proposed scheme can successfully traverse the features of volumes and their temporal behaviors through the constructed contour trees.
Calico, a dynamic tool for the creation and manipulation of color mappings for the exploration of multivariate, quantitative data, was used to study the effects of user control and smooth change on user preference, accuracy, and confidence. The results of the study, as well as other user experiences with Calico, support the hypothesis that dynamic manipulation of color mappings is a useful feature of systems for the exploration of quantitative data using color. The main effect observed is a clear user preference for representations providing control over the mapping, a small but significant increase in accuracy, and greater confidence in information gleaned from manipulable displays. A smaller and less consistent effect showed greater user preference for an confidence in representations which provided smooth change between images.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Flow fields, geodesics, and deformed volumes are natural sources of families of space curves that can be characterized by intrinsic geometric properties such as curvature, torsion, and Frenet frames. By expressing a curve's moving Frenet coordinate frame as an equivalent unit quaternion, we reduce the number of components that must be displayed from nine with six constraints to four with one constraint. We can then assign a color to each curve point by dotting its quaternion frame with a 4D light vector, or we can plot the frame values separately as a curve in the three-sphere. As examples, we examine twisted volumes used in topology to construct knots and tangles, a spherical volume deformation known as the Dirac string trick, and streamlines of 3D vector flow fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Biological sequence similarity analysis presents visualization challenges, primarily because of the massive amounts of discrete, multi dimensional data. Genomic data generated by molecular biologists is analyzed by algorithms that search for similarity to known sequences in large genomic databases. The output from these algorithms can be several thousand pages of text, and is difficult to analyze because of its length and complexity. We developed and implemented a novel graphical representation for sequence similarity search results, which visually reveals features that are difficult to find in textual reports. The method opens new possibilities in the interpretation of this discrete, multidimensional data by enabling interactive investigation of the graphical representation.
Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) allows the holistic visualization of huge volumetric data sets in a single image. Computational fluid dynamics data is in principle well suited for DVR. But efficient mappings of the directional information of vector fields are still to be found. We investigate how the raycasting technique can be used to directly render vector fields. Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this, we developed the idea to shade streamlines at sampling points when raycasting a vector field. We extended this approach further to more abstract mappings where pseudo color is used. Combining opacity mapping, pseudo color mapping, and streamline shading we can express flow speed and flow direction together in one single image.
The use of stream surfaces and streamlines is well established in vector visualization. However, the proper placement of starting points is critical for these constructs to clearly illustrate the flow topology. In this paper, we present the principal stream surface algorithm, which automatically generates stream surfaces that properly depict the topology of an irrotational flow. For each velocity point in the fluid field, we construct the normal to the principal stream surface through the point. The set of all such normal vectors is used to construct the principal stream function, which is a scalar field describing the direction of velocity in the fluid field. Volume rendering can then be used to visualize the principal stream function, which is directly related to the flow topology. Thus, topology in a fluid field can be easily modeled and rendered.
We present an efficient and robust ray-casting algorithm for directly rendering a curvilinear volume of arbitrarily-shaped cells. We designed the algorithm to alleviate the consumption of CPU power and memory space. By incorporating the essence of the projection paradigm into the ray-casting process, we have successfully accelerated the ray traversal through the grid and data interpolations at sample points. Our algorithm also overcomes the conventional limitation requiring the cells to be convex. Application of this algorithm to several commonly-used curvilinear data sets has produced a favorable performance when compared with recently reported algorithms.
Presents a system designed for the interactive definition and visualization of fields derived from large data sets: the Demand-Driven Visualizer (DDV). The system allows the user to write arbitrary expressions to define new fields, and then apply a variety of visualization techniques to the result. Expressions can include differential operators and numerous other built-in functions. Determination of field values, both in space and in time, is directed automatically by the demands of the visualization techniques. The payoff of following a demand-driven design philosophy throughout the visualization system becomes particularly evident when working with large time-series data, where the costs of eager evaluation alternatives can be prohibitive.
We propose a hybrid particle and texture based approach for the visualization of time-dependent vector fields. The underlying space-time framework builds a dense vector field representation in a two-step process: 1) particle-based forward integration of trajectories in spacetime for temporal coherence, and 2) texture-based convolution along another set of paths through the spacetime for spatially correlated patterns. Particle density is controlled by stochastically injecting and removing particles, taking into account the divergence of the vector field. Alternatively, a uniform density can be maintained by placing exactly one particle in each cell of a uniform grid, which leads to particle-in-cell forward advection. Moreover, we discuss strategies of previous visualization methods for unsteady flow and show how they address issues of spatiotemporal coherence and dense visual representations. We demonstrate how our framework is capable of realizing several of these strategies. Finally, we present an efficient GPU implementation that facilitates an interactive visualization of unsteady 2D flow on Shader Model 3 compliant graphics hardware.
This paper is a contribution to the literature on perceptually optimal visualizations of layered three-dimensional surfaces. Specifically, we develop guidelines for generating texture patterns, which, when tiled on two overlapped surfaces, minimize confusion in depth-discrimination and maximize the ability to localize distinct features. We design a parameterized texture space and explore this texture space using a "human in the loop" experimental approach. Subjects are asked to rate their ability to identify Gaussian bumps on both upper and lower surfaces of noisy terrain fields. Their ratings direct a genetic algorithm, which selectively searches the texture parameter space to find fruitful areas. Data collected from these experiments are analyzed to determine what combinations of parameters work well and to develop texture generation guidelines. Data analysis methods include ANOVA, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, and parallel coordinates. To confirm the guidelines, we conduct a post-analysis experiment, where subjects rate textures following our guidelines against textures violating the guidelines. Across all subjects, textures following the guidelines consistently produce high rated textures on an absolute scale, and are rated higher than those that did not follow the guidelines
In order to understand complex vortical flows in large data sets, we must be able to detect and visualize vortices in an automated fashion. In this paper, we present a feature-based vortex detection and visualization technique that is appropriate for large computational fluid dynamics data sets computed on unstructured meshes. In particular, we focus on the application of this technique to visualization of the flow over a serrated wing and the flow field around a spinning missile with dithering canards. We have developed a core line extraction technique based on the observation that vortex cores coincide with local extrema in certain scalar fields. We also have developed a novel technique to handle complex vortex topology that is based on k-means clustering. These techniques facilitate visualization of vortices in simulation data that may not be optimally resolved or sampled. Results are included that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. We conclude by describing how our approach can be improved to enhance robustness and expand its range of applicability
This paper presents an interactive visualization tool to study and analyze hyperspectral images (HSI) of historical documents. This work is part of a collaborative effort with the Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands (NAN) and Art Innovation, a manufacturer of hyperspectral imaging hardware designed for old and fragile documents. The NAN is actively capturing HSI of historical documents for use in a variety of tasks related to the analysis and management of archival collections, from ink and paper analysis to monitoring the effects of environmental aging. To assist their work, we have developed a comprehensive visualization tool that offers an assortment of visualization and analysis methods, including interactive spectral selection, spectral similarity analysis, time-varying data analysis and visualization, and selective spectral band fusion. This paper describes our visualization software and how it is used to facilitate the tasks needed by our collaborators. Evaluation feedback from our collaborators on how this tool benefits their work is included.
Some ideas and techniques for visualizing volumetric data are introduced. The methods presented are different from both the volume rendering techniques and surface contour methods. Volumetric data is data with a domain of three independent variables. The independent variables do not have to indicate a position in space and can be abstract in the sense that they can represent any quantity. The authors cover only the case where the dependent data is a single scalar. The authors describe a collection of techniques and ideas for graphing cuberille grid data. All of these techniques are quite simple and rather easy to implement. During the development of these techniques, the authors were particularly concerned with allowing the user to interact with the system in order to interrogate and analyze the relationships indicated by the volumetric data.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An improvement to visualization systems that provides a graphics window into an application displaying program data at run-time through an easy-to-use graphical interface is discussed. With little or no instrumentation of the application the user will be able to dynamically select data for graphical display as the program executes on a remote computer system. The data to be displayed and the type of display to be used are chosen interactively while the application is executing. Any data display can be enabled and disabled at any time; it is not necessary to specify the data or graphics technique before compilation as with conventional graphics tools. An architecture for such a remote visualization system is proposed, and an implementation, called Vista, is described. Designed primarily for scientific visualization, Vista or offers an environment for more effective debugging and program development.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
VISUAL 3, a highly interactive environment for the visualization of 3D volumetric scientific data, is described. The volume can be broken up in a structured or unstructured manner, and the problem can be static or unsteady in time. Because the data are volumetric and all the information can be changing, traditional CAD techniques are not appropriate. Therefore, VISUAL3 was developed using intermediate mode-rendering methods. A unique aspect of VISUAL3 is the dimensional windowing approach coupled with cursor mapping, which allows efficient pointing in 3D space. VISUAL3 is composed of a large number of visualization tools that can be generally classified into identification, scanning, and probing techniques.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In the work we present a new architecture for visualization systems that is based on data base management system (DBMS) technology. By building on the mechanisms present in a next-generation DBMS, rather than merely on the capabilities of a standard file manager, we show that a simpler and more powerful visualization system can be constructed. We retain the popular "boxes and arrows" programming notation for constructing visualization programs, but add a "flight simulator" model of movement to navigate the output of such programs. In addition, we provide a means to specify a hierarchy of abstracts of data of different types and resolutions, so that a "zoom" capability can be supported. The underlying DBMS support for this system, Tioga, is briefly described, as well as the current state of the implementation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper reports on the development of a strategy to generate databases used for real-time interactive landscape visualization. The database construction from real world data is intended to be as automated as possible. The primary sources of information are remote sensing imagery recorded by Landsat's Thematic Mapper (TM) and digital elevation models (DEM). Additional datasets (traffic networks and buildings) are added to extend the database. In a first step the TM images are geocoded and then segmented into areas of different land coverage. During the visual simulation highly detailed photo textures are applied onto the terrain based on the classification results to increase the apparent amount of detail. The data processing and integration is carried out using custom image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) software. Finally, a sample visual simulation application is implemented. Emphasis is put on practical implementation to test the feasibility of the approach as a whole.
Since 1991, our team of computer scientists, chemists and physicists have worked together to develop an advanced, virtual-environment interface to scanned-probe microscopes. The interface has provided insights and useful capabilities well beyond those of the traditional interface. This paper lists the particular visualization and control techniques that have enabled actual scientific discovery, including specific examples of insight gained using each technique. This information can help scientists determine which features are likely to be useful in their particular application, and which would be just sugar coating. It can also guide computer scientists to suggest the appropriate type of interface to help solve a particular problem. We have found benefit in advanced rendering with natural viewpoint control (but not always), from semi-automatic control techniques, from force feedback during manipulation, and from storing/replaying data for an entire experiment. These benefits come when the system is well-integrated into the existing tool and allows export of the data to standard visualization packages.
Rendering objects transparently gives additional insight in complex and overlapping structures. However, traditional techniques for the rendering of transparent objects such as alpha blending are not very well suited for the rendering of multiple transparent objects in dynamic scenes. Screen door transparency is a technique to render transparent objects in a simple and efficient way: no sorting is required and intersecting polygons can be handled without further preprocessing. With this technique, polygons are rendered through a mask: only where the mask is present, pixels are set. However, artifacts such as incorrect opacities and distracting patterns can easily occur if the masks are not carefully designed. The requirements on the masks are considered. Next, three algorithms are presented for the generation of pixel masks. One algorithm is designed for the creation of small (e.g. 4/spl times/4) masks. The other two algorithms can be used for the creation of larger masks (e.g. 32/spl times/32). For each of these algorithms, results are presented and discussed.
We propose a general paradigm for computing optimal coordinate frame fields that may be exploited to visualize curves and surfaces. Parallel transport framings, which work well for open curves, generally fail to have desirable properties for cyclic curves and for surfaces. We suggest that minimal quaternion measure provides an appropriate heuristic generalization of parallel transport. Our approach differs from minimal tangential acceleration approaches due to the addition of "sliding ring" constraints that fix one frame axis, but allow an axial rotational freedom whose value is varied in the optimization process. Our fundamental tool is the quaternion Gauss map, a generalization to quaternion space of the tangent map for curves and of the Gauss map for surfaces. The quaternion Gauss map takes 3D coordinate frame fields for curves and surfaces into corresponding curves and surfaces constrained to the space of possible orientations in quaternion space. Standard optimization tools provide application specific means of choosing optimal, e.g., length- or area-minimizing, quaternion frame fields in this constrained space.
The delivery of the first one tera-operations/sec computer has significantly impacted production data visualization, affecting data transfer, post processing, and rendering. Terascale computing has motivated a need to consider the entire data visualization system; improving a single algorithm is not sufficient. This paper presents a systems approach to decrease by a factor of four the time required to prepare large data sets for visualization. For daily production use, all stages in the processing pipeline from physics simulation code to pixels on a screen, must be balanced to yield good overall performance. Performance of the initial visualization system is compared with recent improvements. "Lessons learned" from the coordinated deployment of improved algorithms also are discussed, including the need for 64 bit addressing and a fully parallel data visualization pipeline.
This paper presents results for real-time visualization of out-of-core collections of 3D objects. This is a significant extension of previous methods and shows the generality of hierarchical paging procedures applied both to global terrain and any objects that reside on it. Applied to buildings, the procedure shows the effectiveness of using a screen-based paging and display criterion within a hierarchical framework. The results demonstrate that the method is scalable since it is able to handle multiple collections of buildings (e.g., cities) placed around the earth with full interactivity and without extensive memory load. Further the method shows efficient handling of culling and is applicable to larger, extended collections of buildings. Finally, the method shows that levels of detail can be incorporated to provide improved detail management.
We present a fast and reliable space-leaping scheme to accelerate ray casting during interactive navigation in a complex volumetric scene, where we combine innovative space-leaping techniques in a number of ways. First, we derive most of the pixel depths at the current frame by exploiting the temporal coherence during navigation, where we employ a novel fast cell-based reprojection scheme that is more reliable than the traditional intersection-point based reprojection. Next, we exploit the object space coherence to quickly detect the remaining pixel depths, by using a precomputed accurate distance field that stores the Euclidean distance from each empty (background) voxel toward its nearest object boundary. In addition, we propose an effective solution to the challenging new-incoming-objects problem during navigation. Our algorithm has been implemented on a 16-processor SGI Power Challenge and reached interactive rendering rates at more than 10 Hz during the navigation inside 512/sup 3/ volume data sets acquired from both a simulation phantom and actual patients.
In this case study, we explore techniques for the purpose of visualizing isolated flow structures in time-dependent data. Our primary industrial application is the visualization of the vortex rope, a rotating helical structure which builds up in the draft tube of a water turbine. The vortex rope can be characterized by high values of normalized helicity, which is a scalar field derived from the given CFD velocity data. In two related applications, the goal is to visualize the cavitation regions near the runner blades of a Kaplan turbine and a water pump, respectively. Again, the flow structure of interest can be defined by a scalar field, namely by low pressure values. We propose a particle seeding scheme based on quasi-random numbers, which minimizes visual artifacts such as clusters or patterns. By constraining the visualization to a region of interest, occlusion problems are reduced and storage efficiency is gained.
This work presents an experimental immersive interface for designing DNA components for application in nanotechnology. While much research has been done on immersive visualization, this is one of the first systems to apply advanced interface techniques to a scientific design problem. This system uses tangible 3D input devices (tongs, a raygun, and a multipurpose handle tool) to create and edit a purely digital representation of DNA. The tangible controllers are associated with functions (not data) while a virtual display is used to render the model. This interface was built in collaboration with a research group investigating the design of DNA tiles. A user study shows that scientists find the immersive interface more satisfying than a 2D interface due to the enhanced understanding gained by directly interacting with molecules in 3D space.
Many large scale physics-based simulations which take place on PC clusters or supercomputers produce huge amounts of data including vector fields. While these vector data such as electromagnetic fields, fluid flow fields, or particle paths can be represented by lines, the sheer number of the lines overwhelms the memory and computation capability of a high-end PC used for visualization. Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.
A new technique is presented to increase the performance of volume splatting by using hardware accelerated point sprites. This allows creating screen aligned elliptical splats for high quality volume splatting at very low cost on the GPU. Only one vertex per splat is stored on the graphics card. GPU generated point sprite texture coordinates are used for computing splats and per-fragment 3D-texture coordinates on the fly. Thus, only 6 bytes per splat are stored on the GPU and vertex shader load is 25% in comparison to applying textured quads. For eight predefined viewing directions, depth-sorting of the splats is performed in a pre-processing step where the resulting indices are stored on the GPU. Thereby, there is no data transfer between CPU and GPU during rendering. Post-classificative two dimensional transfer functions with lighting for scalar data and tagged volumes were implemented. Thereby, we focused on the visualization of neurovascular structures, where typically no more than 2% of the voxels contribute to the resulting 3D-representation. A comparison with a 3D-texture-based slicing algorithm showed frame rates up to 11 times higher for the presented approach on current CPUs. The presented technique was evaluated with a broad medical database and its value for highly sparse volume visualization is shown.
We introduce and analyze an efficient reconstruction algorithm for FCC-sampled data. The reconstruction is based on the 6-direction box spline that is naturally associated with the FCC lattice and shares the continuity and approximation order of the triquadratic B-spline. We observe less aliasing for generic level sets and derive special techniques to attain the higher evaluation efficiency promised by the lower degree and smaller stencil-size of the C1 6-direction box spline over the triquadratic B-spline.
The analysis of multi-timepoint whole-body small animal CT data is greatly complicated by the varying posture of the subject at different timepoints. Due to these variations, correctly relating and comparing corresponding regions of interest is challenging.In addition, occlusion may prevent effective visualization of these regions of interest. To address these problems, we have developed a method that fully automatically maps the data to a standardized layout of sub-volumes, based on an articulated atlas registration.We have dubbed this process articulated planar reformation, or APR. A sub-volume can be interactively selected for closer inspection and can be compared with the corresponding sub-volume at the other timepoints, employing a number of different comparative visualization approaches. We provide an additional tool that highlights possibly interesting areas based on the change of bone density between timepoints. Furthermore we allow visualization of the local registration error, to give an indication of the accuracy of the registration. We have evaluated our approach on a case that exhibits cancer-induced bone resorption.
The concept of continuous scatterplot (CSP) is a modern visualization technique. The idea is to define a scalar density value based on the map between an n-dimensional spatial domain and an m-dimensional data domain, which describe the CSP space. Usually the data domain is two-dimensional to visually convey the underlying, density coded, data. In this paper we investigate kinds of map-based discontinuities, especially for the practical cases n = m = 2 and n = 3 | m = 2, and we depict relations between them and attributes of the resulting CSP itself. Additionally, we show that discontinuities build critical line structures, and we introduce algorithms to detect them. Further, we introduce a discontinuity-based visualization approach - called contribution map (CM) -which establishes a relationship between the CSP's data domain and the number of connected components in the spatial domain. We show that CMs enhance the CSP-based linking &amp;amp; brushing interaction. Finally, we apply our approaches to a number of synthetic as well as real data sets.
This paper introduces a novel importance measure for critical points in 2D scalar fields. This measure is based on a combination of the deep structure of the scale space with the well-known concept of homological persistence. We enhance the noise robust persistence measure by implicitly taking the hill-, ridge- and outlier-like spatial extent of maxima and minima into account. This allows for the distinction between different types of extrema based on their persistence at multiple scales. Our importance measure can be computed efficiently in an out-of-core setting. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our method we apply it to a synthetic and a real-world data set and evaluate its performance and scalability.
The authors maintain that of particular importance for visualization excellence is an understanding of effective deictic facilities, especially new techniques made possible by computation. They explain what deixis is and why it is fundamental to visualization and they analyze some of the requirements for effective deixis in the context of emergent visualization technology.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Different techniques have been proposed for rendering volumetric scalar data sets. Usually these approaches are focusing on orthogonal cartesian grids, but in the last years research did also concentrate on arbitrary structured or even unstructured topologies. In particular, direct volume rendering of these data types is numerically complex and mostly requires sorting the whole database. We present a new approach to direct rendering of convex, voluminous polyhedra on arbitrary grid topologies, which efficiently use hardware assisted polygon drawing to support the sorting procedure. The key idea of this technique lies in a two pass rendering approach. First, the volume primitives are drawn in polygon mode to obtain their cross sections in the VSBUFFER orthogonal to the viewing plane. Second, this buffer is traversed in front to back order and the volume integration is performed. Thus, the complexity of the sorting procedure is reduced. Furthermore, any connectivity information can be completely neglected, which allows for the rendering of arbitrary scattered, convex polyhedra.
Efforts to create highly generic visualizations, both content and interface, often when applied to non research oriented or operational activities are composed of several goals. Although these goals may appear to be related, they are often composed of distinct tasks. Generic solutions, even if domain-specific, may lack sufficient focus to be effective for such purposes. The design of different visualization tools matched to a set of tasks but built on top of a common framework with a similar approach to content is a promising alternative. This hypothesis is tested in detail by application to a demanding problem-operational weather forecasting.
We explore techniques to detect and visualize features in data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Although the techniques proposed are general, we focus on silicon (Si) atomic systems. The first set of methods use 3D location of atoms. Defects are detected and categorized using local operators and statistical modeling. Our second set of exploratory techniques employ electron density data. This data is visualized to glean the defects. We describe techniques to automatically detect the salient isovalues for isosurface extraction and designing transfer functions. We compare and contrast the results obtained from both sources of data. Essentially, we find that the methods of defect (feature) detection are at least as robust as those based on the exploration of electron density for Si systems.
Resampling is a frequent task in visualization and medical imaging. It occurs whenever images or volumes are magnified, rotated, translated, or warped. Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multimodal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. We explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.
The problem of perceptually optimizing complex visualizations is a difficult one, involving perceptual as well as aesthetic issues. In our experience, controlled experiments are quite limited in their ability to uncover interrelationships among visualization parameters, and thus may not be the most useful way to develop rules-of-thumb or theory to guide the production of high-quality visualizations. In this paper, we propose a new experimental approach to optimizing visualization quality that integrates some of the strong points of controlled experiments with methods more suited to investigating complex highly-coupled phenomena. We use human-in-the-loop experiments to search through visualization parameter space, generating large databases of rated visualization solutions. This is followed by data mining to extract results such as exemplar visualizations, guidelines for producing visualizations, and hypotheses about strategies leading to strong visualizations. The approach can easily address both perceptual and aesthetic concerns, and can handle complex parameter interactions. We suggest a genetic algorithm as a valuable way of guiding the human-in-the-loop search through visualization parameter space. We describe our methods for using clustering, histogramming, principal component analysis, and neural networks for data mining. The experimental approach is illustrated with a study of the problem of optimal texturing for viewing layered surfaces so that both surfaces are maximally observable.
Vortices are undesirable in many applications while indispensable in others. It is therefore of common interest to understand their mechanisms of creation. This paper aims at analyzing the transport of vorticity inside incompressible flow. The analysis is based on the vorticity equation and is performed along pathlines which are typically started in upstream direction from vortex regions. Different methods for the quantitative and explorative analysis of vorticity transport are presented and applied to CFD simulations of water turbines. Simulation quality is accounted for by including the errors of meshing and convergence into analysis and visualization. The obtained results are discussed and interpretations with respect to engineering questions are given
Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.
Streak surfaces are among the most important features to support 3D unsteady flow exploration, but they are also among the computationally most demanding. Furthermore, to enable a feature driven analysis of the flow, one is mainly interested in streak surfaces that show separation profiles and thus detect unstable manifolds in the flow. The computation of such separation surfaces requires to place seeding structures at the separation locations and to let the structures move correspondingly to these locations in the unsteady flow. Since only little knowledge exists about the time evolution of separating streak surfaces, at this time, an automated exploration of 3D unsteady flows using such surfaces is not feasible. Therefore, in this paper we present an interactive approach for the visual analysis of separating streak surfaces. Our method draws upon recent work on the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and the real-time visualization of streak surfaces on the GPU. We propose an interactive technique for computing ridges in the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field at each time step, and we use these ridges as seeding structures to track streak surfaces in the time-varying flow. By showing separation surfaces in combination with particle trajectories, and by letting the user interactively change seeding parameters such as particle density and position, visually guided exploration of separation profiles in 3D is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the reconstruction and display of semantic separable surfaces in 3D unsteady flows can be performed interactively, giving rise to new possibilities for gaining insight into complex flow phenomena.
In recent years, many volumetric illumination models have been proposed, which have the potential to simulate advanced lighting effects and thus support improved image comprehension. Although volume ray-casting is widely accepted as the volume rendering technique which achieves the highest image quality, so far no volumetric illumination algorithm has been designed to be directly incorporated into the ray-casting process. In this paper we propose image plane sweep volume illumination (IPSVI), which allows the integration of advanced illumination effects into a GPU-based volume ray-caster by exploiting the plane sweep paradigm. Thus, we are able to reduce the problem complexity and achieve interactive frame rates, while supporting scattering as well as shadowing. Since all illumination computations are performed directly within a single rendering pass, IPSVI does not require any preprocessing nor does it need to store intermediate results within an illumination volume. It therefore has a significantly lower memory footprint than other techniques. This makes IPSVI directly applicable to large data sets. Furthermore, the integration into a GPU-based ray-caster allows for high image quality as well as improved rendering performance by exploiting early ray termination. This paper discusses the theory behind IPSVI, describes its implementation, demonstrates its visual results and provides performance measurements.
The authors discuss effective techniques for representing scalar and vector valued functions that interpolate to irregularly located data. Special attention is given to the situations where the sampling domain is a two-dimensional plane, 3-D volume, or a closed 3-D surface. The authors first discuss the multiquadric and thin-plate spline methods for interpolating scalar data sampled at arbitrary locations in a plane. Straightforward generalizations are then made to data sampled in 3-D volumetric regions as well as in higher dimensional spaces. The globally defined interpolants can be evaluated on a fine regular grid and they can then be visualized using conventional techniques. Triangular and tetrahedral based visualization techniques are also presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Air flowing around the wing tips of an airplane forms horizontal tornado-like vortices that can be dangerous to following aircraft. The dynamics of such vortices, including ground and atmospheric effects, can be predicted by numerical simulation, allowing the safety and capacity of airports to be improved. We introduce three-dimensional techniques for visualizing time-dependent, two-dimensional wake vortex computations, and the hazard strength of such vortices near the ground. We describe a vortex core tracing algorithm and a local tiling method to visualize the vortex evolution. The tiling method converts time-dependent, two-dimensional vortex cores into three-dimensional vortex tubes. Finally, a novel approach is used to calculate the induced rolling moment on the following airplane at each grid point within a region near the vortex tubes and thus allows three-dimensional visualization of the hazard strength of the vortices.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A standard method for visualizing vector fields consists of drawing many small "glyphs" to represent the field. This paper extends the technique from regular to curvilinear and unstructured grids. In order to achieve a uniform density of vector glyphs on nonuniformly spaced grids, the paper describes two approaches to resampling the grid data. One of the methods, an element-based resampling, can be used to visualize vector fields at arbitrary surfaces within three-dimensional grids.
Modular visualization environments (MVEs) have recently been regarded as the de facto standard for scientific data visualization, mainly due to adoption of the visual programming style, reusability, and extendability. However, since scientists and engineers as the MVE principal user are not always familiar with how to map numerical data to proper graphical primitives, the set of built-in modules is not fully used to construct necessary application networks. Therefore, a certain mechanism needs to be incorporated into MVEs, which makes use of heuristics and expertise of visualization specialists (visineers), and which supports the user in designing his/her applications with MVEs. The Wehrend's goal-oriented taxonomy of visualization techniques is adopted as the basic philosophy to develop a system, called GADGET, for application design guidance for MVEs. The GADGET system interactively helps the user design appropriate applications according to the specific visualization goals, temporal efficiency versus accuracy requirements, and such properties as dimension and mesh type of a given target dataset. Also the GADGET system is capable of assisting the user in customizing a prototype modular network for his/her desired applications by showing execution examples involving datasets of the same type. The paper provides an overview of the GADGET guidance mechanism and system architecture, with an emphasis on its knowledge base design. Sample data visualization problems are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the GADGET system.
Often, images or datasets have to be compared to facilitate choices of visualization and simulation parameters respectively. Common comparison techniques include side-by-side viewing and juxtaposition, in order to facilitate visual verification of verisimilitude. We propose quantitative techniques which accentuate differences in images and datasets. The comparison is enabled through a collection of partial metrics which, essentially, measure the lack of correlation between the datasets or images being compared. That is, they attempt to expose and measure the extent of the inherent structures in the difference between images or datasets. Besides yielding numerical attributes, the metrics also produce images which can visually highlight differences. Our metrics are simple to compute and operate in the spatial domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics through examples for comparing images and datasets.
A method for comparing three-dimensional vector fields constructed from simple critical points is described. This method is a natural extension of previous work (Y. Lavin et al., 1998), which defined a distance metric for comparing two-dimensional fields. The extension to three-dimensions follows the path of our previous work, rethinking the representation of a critical point signature and the distance measure between the points. Since the method relies on topologically based information, problems such as grid matching and vector alignment which often complicate other comparison techniques are avoided. In addition, since only feature information is used to represent, and is therefore stored for each field, a significant amount of compression occurs.
GeneVis provides a visual environment for exploring the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. At present time, genetic regulation is the focus of intensive research worldwide, and computational aids are being called for to help in the research of factors that are difficult to observe directly. GeneVis provides a particle-based simulation of genetic networks and visualizes the process of this simulation as it occurs. Two dynamic visualization techniques are provided, a visualization of the movement of the regulatory proteins and a visualization of the relative concentrations of these proteins. Several interactive tools relate the dynamic visualizations to the underlying genetic network structure.
For quantitative examination of phenomena that simultaneously occur on very different spatial and temporal scales, adaptive hierarchical schemes are required. A special numerical multilevel technique, associated with a particular hierarchical data structure, is so-called adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). It allows one to bridge a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions and therefore gains increasing popularity. We describe the interplay of several visualization and VR software packages for rendering time dependent AMR simulations of the evolution of the first star in the universe. The work was done in the framework of a television production for Discovery Channel television, "The Unfolding Universe.". Parts of the data were taken from one of the most complex AMR simulation ever carried out: It contained up to 27 levels of resolution, requiring modifications to the texture based AMR volume rendering algorithm that was used to depict the density distribution of the gaseous interstellar matter. A voice and gesture controlled CAVE application was utilized to define camera paths following the interesting features deep inside the computational domains. Background images created from cosmological computational data were combined with the final renderings.
There are numerous algorithms in graphics and visualization whose performance is known to decay as the topological complexity of the input increases. On the other hand, the standard pipeline for 3D geometry acquisition often produces 3D models that are topologically more complex than their real forms. We present a simple and efficient algorithm that allows us to simplify the topology of an isosurface by alternating the values of some number of voxels. Its utility and performance are demonstrated on several examples, including signed distance functions from polygonal models and CT scans.
In this paper, we describe a methodology and implementation for interactive dataset traversal using motion-controlled transfer functions. Dataset traversal here refers lo the process of translating a transfer function along a specific path. In scientific visualization, it is often necessary to manipulate transfer functions in order to visualize datasets more effectively. This manipulation of transfer functions is usually performed globally, i.e., a new transfer function is applied to the entire dataset. Our approach allows one to locally manipulate transfer functions while controling its movement along a traversal path. The method we propose allows the user to select a traversal path within the dataset, based on the shape of the volumetric model and manipulate a transfer function along this path. Examples of dataset traversal include the animation of transfer functions along a pre-defined path, the simulation of flow in vascular structures, and the visualization of convoluted shapes. For example, this type of traversal is often used in medical illustration to highlight flow in blood vessels. We present an interactive implementation of our method using graphics hardware, based on the decomposition of the volume. We show examples of our approach using a variety of volumetric datasets, and we also demonstrate that with our novel decomposition, the rendering process is faster.
This paper presents a novel approach for surface reconstruction from point clouds. The proposed technique is general in the sense that it naturally handles both manifold and non-manifold surfaces, providing a consistent way for reconstructing closed surfaces as well as surfaces with boundaries. It is also robust in the presence of noise, irregular sampling and surface gaps. Furthermore, it is fast, parallelizable and easy to implement because it is based on simple local operations. In this approach, surface reconstruction consists of three major steps: first, the space containing the point cloud is subdivided, creating a voxel representation. Then, a voxel surface is computed using gap filling and topological thinning operations. Finally, the resulting voxel surface is converted into a polygonal mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing polygonal models from range scans of real objects as well as from synthetic data.
Displays combining both 2D and 3D views have been shown to support higher performance on certain visualization tasks. However, it is not clear how best to arrange a combination of 2D and 3D views spatially in a display. In this study, we analyzed the eyegaze strategies of participants using two arrangements of 2D and 3D views to estimate the relative position of objects in a 3D scene. Our results show that the 3D view was used significantly more often than individual 2D views in both displays, indicating the importance of the 3D view for successful task completion. However, viewing patterns were significantly different between the two displays: transitions through centrally-placed views were always more frequent, and users avoided saccades between views that were far apart. Although the change in viewing strategy did not result in significant performance differences, error analysis indicates that a 3D overview in the center may reduce the number of serious errors compared to a 3D overview placed off to the side.
We propose a novel, geometrically adaptive method for surface reconstruction from noisy and sparse point clouds, without orientation information. The method employs a fast convection algorithm to attract the evolving surface towards the data points. The force field in which the surface is convected is based on generalized Coulomb potentials evaluated on an adaptive grid (i.e., an octree) using a fast, hierarchical algorithm. Formulating reconstruction as a convection problem in a velocity field generated by Coulomb potentials offers a number of advantages. Unlike methods which compute the distance from the data set to the implicit surface, which are sensitive to noise due to the very reliance on the distance transform, our method is highly resilient to shot noise since global, generalized Coulomb potentials can be used to disregard the presence of outliers due to noise. Coulomb potentials represent long-range interactions that consider all data points at once, and thus they convey global information which is crucial in the fitting process. Both the spatial and temporal complexities of our spatially-adaptive method are proportional to the size of the reconstructed object, which makes our method compare favorably with respect to previous approaches in terms of speed and flexibility. Experiments with sparse as well as noisy data sets show that the method is capable of delivering crisp and detailed yet smooth surfaces.
The effective visualization of vascular structures is critical for diagnosis, surgical planning as well as treatment evaluation. In recent work, we have developed an algorithm for vessel detection that examines the intensity profile around each voxel in an angiographic image and determines the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a vessel; we term this the "vesselness coefficient" of the voxel. Our results show that our algorithm works particularly well for visualizing branch points in vessels. Compared to standard Hessian based techniques, which are fine-tuned to identify long cylindrical structures, our technique identifies branches and connections with other vessels. Using our computed vesselness coefficient, we explore a set of techniques for visualizing vasculature. Visualizing vessels is particularly challenging because not only is their position in space important for clinicians but it is also important to be able to resolve their spatial relationship. We applied visualization techniques that provide shape cues as well as depth cues to allow the viewer to differentiate between vessels that are closer from those that are farther. We use our computed vesselness coefficient to effectively visualize vasculature in both clinical neurovascular x-ray computed tomography based angiography images, as well as images from three different animal studies. We conducted a formal user evaluation of our visualization techniques with the help of radiologists, surgeons, and other expert users. Results indicate that experts preferred distance color blending and tone shading for conveying depth over standard visualization techniques.
The visualization and analysis of AMR-based simulations is integral to the process of obtaining new insight in scientific research. We present a new method for performing query-driven visualization and analysis on AMR data, with specific emphasis on time-varying AMR data. Our work introduces a new method that directly addresses the dynamic spatial and temporal properties of AMR grids that challenge many existing visualization techniques. Further, we present the first implementation of query-driven visualization on the GPU that uses a GPU-based indexing structure to both answer queries and efficiently utilize GPU memory. We apply our method to two different science domains to demonstrate its broad applicability.
In modern clinical practice, planning access paths to volumetric target structures remains one of the most important and most complex tasks, and a physician's insufficient experience in this can lead to severe complications or even the death of the patient. In this paper, we present a method for safety evaluation and the visualization of access paths to assist physicians during preoperative planning. As a metaphor for our method, we employ a well-known, and thus intuitively perceivable, natural phenomenon that is usually called crepuscular rays. Using this metaphor, we propose several ways to compute the safety of paths from the region of interest to all tumor voxels and show how this information can be visualized in real-time using a multi-volume rendering system. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the extent of connected safe areas to improve common medical 2D multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) views. We evaluate our method by means of expert interviews, an online survey, and a retrospective evaluation of 19 real abdominal radio-frequency ablation (RFA) interventions, with expert decisions serving as a gold standard. The evaluation results show clear evidence that our method can be successfully applied in clinical practice without introducing substantial overhead work for the acting personnel. Finally, we show that our method is not limited to medical applications and that it can also be useful in other fields.
Flood disasters are the most common natural risk and tremendous efforts are spent to improve their simulation and management. However, simulation-based investigation of actions that can be taken in case of flood emergencies is rarely done. This is in part due to the lack of a comprehensive framework which integrates and facilitates these efforts. In this paper, we tackle several problems which are related to steering a flood simulation. One issue is related to uncertainty. We need to account for uncertain knowledge about the environment, such as levee-breach locations. Furthermore, the steering process has to reveal how these uncertainties in the boundary conditions affect the confidence in the simulation outcome. Another important problem is that the simulation setup is often hidden in a black-box. We expose system internals and show that simulation steering can be comprehensible at the same time. This is important because the domain expert needs to be able to modify the simulation setup in order to include local knowledge and experience. In the proposed solution, users steer parameter studies through the World Lines interface to account for input uncertainties. The transport of steering information to the underlying data-flow components is handled by a novel meta-flow. The meta-flow is an extension to a standard data-flow network, comprising additional nodes and ropes to abstract parameter control. The meta-flow has a visual representation to inform the user about which control operations happen. Finally, we present the idea to use the data-flow diagram itself for visualizing steering information and simulation results. We discuss a case-study in collaboration with a domain expert who proposes different actions to protect a virtual city from imminent flooding. The key to choosing the best response strategy is the ability to compare different regions of the parameter space while retaining an understanding of what is happening inside the data-flow system.
The authors address the problem of visualizing a scalar dependent variable which is a function of many independent variables. In particular, cases where the number of independent variables is three or greater are discussed. A new hierarchical method of plotting that allows one to interactively view millions of data points with up to 10 independent variables is presented. The technique is confined to the case where each independent variable is sampled in a regular grid or lattice-like fashion, i.e., in equal increments. The proposed technique can be described in either an active or a passive manner. In the active view the points of the N-dimensional independent variables lattice are mapped to a single horizontal axis in a hierarchical manner, while in the passive view an observer samples the points of the N-dimensional lattice in a prescribed fashion and notes the values of the dependent variable. In the passive view a plot of the dependent variable versus a single parametric variable, which is simply the sampling number, forms the multidimensional graph.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;

General relativistic ray tracing is presented as a tool for gravitational physics. It is shown how standard three-dimensional ray tracing can be extended to allow for general relativistic visualization. This visualization technique provides images as seen by an observer under the influence of a gravitational field and allows to probe space-time by null geodesics. Moreover, a technique is proposed for visualizing the caustic surfaces generated by a gravitational lens. The suitability of general relativistic ray tracing is demonstrated by means of two examples, namely the visualization of the rigidly rotating disk of dust and the warp drive metric.
Using inductive learning techniques to construct classification models from large, high-dimensional data sets is a useful way to make predictions in complex domains. However, these models can be difficult for users to understand. We have developed a set of visualization methods that help users to understand and analyze the behavior of learned models, including techniques for high-dimensional data space projection, display of probabilistic predictions, variable/class correlation, and instance mapping. We show the results of applying these techniques to models constructed from a benchmark data set of census data, and draw conclusions about the utility of these methods for model understanding.
The visualization of time-dependent flow is an important and challenging topic in scientific visualization. Its aim is to represent transport phenomena governed by time-dependent vector fields in an intuitively understandable way, using images and animations. Here we pick up the recently presented anisotropic diffusion method, expand and generalize it to allow a multiscale visualization of long-term, complex transport problems. Instead of streamline type patterns generated by the original method now streakline patterns are generated and advected. This process obeys a nonlinear transport diffusion equation with typically dominant transport. Starting from some noisy initial image, the diffusion actually generates and enhances patterns which are then transported in the direction of the flow field. Simultaneously the image is again sharpened in the direction orthogonal to the flow field. A careful adjustment of the models parameters is derived to balance diffusion and transport effects in a reasonable way. Properties of the method can be discussed for the continuous model, which is solved by an efficient upwind finite element discretization. As characteristic for the class of multiscale image processing methods, we can in advance select a suitable scale for representing the flow field.
In this paper we address the problem of interactively resampling unstructured grids. Three algorithms are presented. They all allow adaptive resampling of an unstructured grid on a multiresolution hierarchy of arbitrarily sized cartesian grids according to a varying element size. Two of the algorithms presented take advantage of hardware accelerated polygon rendering and 2D texture mapping. In exploiting new features of modem PC graphics adapters, the first algorithm tries to significantly minimize the number of polygons to be rendered. Reducing rasterization requirements is the main goal of the second algorithm, which distributes the computational workload differently between the main processor and the graphics chip. By comparing them to a new pure software approach, an optimal software-hardware balance is studied. We end up with a hybrid approach which greatly improves the performance of hardware assisted resampling by involving the main processor to a higher degree and thus enabling resampling at nearly interactive rates.
It is of significant interest for neurological studies to determine and visualize neuronal fiber pathways in the human brain. By exploiting the capability of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging to detect local orientations of neuronal fibers, we have developed a system of algorithms to reconstruct, visualize and quantify neuronal fiber pathways in vivo. Illustrative results show that the system is a promising tool for visual analysis of fiber connectivity and quantitative studies of neuronal fibers.
We describe a method for volume rendering using a spectral representation of colour instead of the traditional RGB model. It is shown how to use this framework for a novel exploration of datasets through enhanced transfer function design. Furthermore, our framework is extended to allow real-time re-lighting of the scene created with any rendering method. The technique of post-illumination is introduced to generate new spectral images for arbitrary light colours in real-time. Also a tool is described to design a palette of lights and materials having certain properties such as selective metamerism or colour constancy. Applied to spectral transfer functions, different light colours can accentuate or hide specific qualities of the data. In connection with post-illumination this provides a new degree of freedom for guided exploration of volumetric data, which cannot be achieved using the RGB model.
Typically 3-D MR and CT scans have a relatively high resolution in the scanning X-Y plane, but much lower resolution in the axial Z direction. This non-uniform sampling of an object can miss small or thin structures. One way to address this problem is to scan the same object from multiple directions. In this paper we describe a method for deforming a level set model using velocity information derived from multiple volume datasets with non-uniform resolution in order to produce a single high-resolution 3D model. The method locally approximates the values of the multiple datasets by fitting a distance-weighted polynomial using moving least-squares. The proposed method has several advantageous properties: its computational cost is proportional to the object surface area, it is stable with respect to noise, imperfect registrations and abrupt changes in the data, it provides gain-correction, and it employs a distance-based weighting to ensures that the contributions from each scan are properly merged into the final result. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on four multi-scan datasets, a Griffin laser scan reconstruction, a CT scan of a teapot and MR scans of a mouse embryo and a zucchini.

Indirect volume rendering is a widespread method for the display of volume datasets. It is based on the extraction of polygonal iso-surfaces from volumetric data, which are then rendered using conventional rasterization methods. Whereas this rendering approach is fast and relatively easy to implement, it cannot easily provide an understandable display of structures occluded by the directly visible iso-surface. Simple approaches like alpha-blending for transparency when drawing the iso-surface often generate a visually complex output, which is difficult to interpret. Moreover, such methods can significantly increase the computational complexity of the rendering process. In this paper, we therefore propose a new approach for the illustrative indirect rendering of volume data in real-time. This algorithm emphasizes the silhouette of objects represented by the iso-surface. Additionally, shading intensities on objects are reproduced with a monochrome hatching technique. Using a specially designed two-pass rendering process, structures behind the front layer of the iso-surface are automatically extracted with a depth peeling method. The shapes of these hidden structures are also displayed as silhouette outlines. As an additional option, the geometry of explicitly specified inner objects can be displayed with constant translucency. Although these inner objects always remain visible, a specific shading and depth attenuation method is used to convey the depth relationships. We describe the implementation of the algorithm, which exploits the programmability of state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs). The algorithm described in this paper does not require any preprocessing of the input data or a manual definition of inner structures. Since the presented method works on iso-surfaces, which are stored as polygonal datasets, it can also be applied to other types of polygonal models.
We present a comparative visualization of the acoustic simulation results obtained by two different approaches that were combined into a single simulation algorithm. The first method solves the wave equation on a volume grid based on finite elements. The second method, phonon tracing, is a geometric approach that we have previously developed for interactive simulation, visualization and modeling of room acoustics. Geometric approaches of this kind are more efficient than FEM in the high and medium frequency range. For low frequencies they fail to represent diffraction, which on the other hand can be simulated properly by means of FEM. When combining both methods we need to calibrate them properly and estimate in which frequency range they provide comparable results. For this purpose we use an acoustic metric called gain and display the resulting error. Furthermore we visualize interference patterns, since these depend not only on diffraction, but also exhibit phase-dependent amplification and neutralization effects
Volumetric datasets with multiple variables on each voxel over multiple time steps are often complex, especially when considering the exponentially large attribute space formed by the variables in combination with the spatial and temporal dimensions. It is intuitive, practical, and thus often desirable, to interactively select a subset of the data from within that high-dimensional value space for efficient visualization. This approach is straightforward to implement if the dataset is small enough to be stored entirely in-core. However, to handle datasets sized at hundreds of gigabytes and beyond, this simplistic approach becomes infeasible and thus, more sophisticated solutions are needed. In this work, we developed a system that supports efficient visualization of an arbitrary subset, selected by range-queries, of a large multivariate time-varying dataset. By employing specialized data structures and schemes of data distribution, our system can leverage a large number of networked computers as parallel data servers, and guarantees a near optimal load-balance. We demonstrate our system of scalable data servers using two large time-varying simulation datasets
Smooth surface extraction using partial differential equations (PDEs) is a well-known and widely used technique for visualizing volume data. Existing approaches operate on gridded data and mainly on regular structured grids. When considering unstructured point-based volume data where sample points do not form regular patterns nor are they connected in any form, one would typically resample the data over a grid prior to applying the known PDE-based methods. We propose an approach that directly extracts smooth surfaces from unstructured point-based volume data without prior resampling or mesh generation. When operating on unstructured data one needs to quickly derive neighborhood information. The respective information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a fed-tree and operating on its cells. We exploit neighborhood information to estimate gradients and mean curvature at every sample point using a four-dimensional least-squares fitting approach. Gradients and mean curvature are required for applying the chosen PDE-based method that combines hyperbolic advection to an isovalue of a given scalar field and mean curvature flow. Since we are using an explicit time-integration scheme, time steps and neighbor locations are bounded to ensure convergence of the process. To avoid small global time steps, one can use asynchronous local integration. We extract a smooth surface by successively fitting a smooth auxiliary function to the data set. This auxiliary function is initialized as a signed distance function. For each sample and for every time step we compute the respective gradient, the mean curvature, and a stable time step. With these informations the auxiliary function is manipulated using an explicit Euler time integration. The process successively continues with the next sample point in time. If the norm of the auxiliary function gradient in a sample exceeds a given threshold at some time, the auxiliary function is reinitialized to a signed distance function. After convergence of the evolvution, the resulting smooth surface is obtained by extracting the zero isosurface from the auxiliary function using direct isosurface extraction from unstructured point-based volume data and rendering the extracted surface using point-based rendering methods.
Visual representations of isosurfaces are ubiquitous in the scientific and engineering literature. In this paper, we present techniques to assess the behavior of isosurface extraction codes. Where applicable, these techniques allow us to distinguish whether anomalies in isosurface features can be attributed to the underlying physical process or to artifacts from the extraction process. Such scientific scrutiny is at the heart of verifiable visualization - subjecting visualization algorithms to the same verification process that is used in other components of the scientific pipeline. More concretely, we derive formulas for the expected order of accuracy (or convergence rate) of several isosurface features, and compare them to experimentally observed results in the selected codes. This technique is practical: in two cases, it exposed actual problems in implementations. We provide the reader with the range of responses they can expect to encounter with isosurface techniques, both under ldquonormal operating conditionsrdquo and also under adverse conditions. Armed with this information - the results of the verification process - practitioners can judiciously select the isosurface extraction technique appropriate for their problem of interest, and have confidence in its behavior.
Over the past few years, large human populations around the world have been affected by an increase in significant seismic activities. For both conducting basic scientific research and for setting critical government policies, it is crucial to be able to explore and understand seismic and geographical information obtained through all scientific instruments. In this work, we present a visual analytics system that enables explorative visualization of seismic data together with satellite-based observational data, and introduce a suite of visual analytical tools. Seismic and satellite data are integrated temporally and spatially. Users can select temporal ;and spatial ranges to zoom in on specific seismic events, as well as to inspect changes both during and after the events. Tools for designing high dimensional transfer functions have been developed to enable efficient and intuitive comprehension of the multi-modal data. Spread-sheet style comparisons are used for data drill-down as well as presentation. Comparisons between distinct seismic events are also provided for characterizing event-wise differences. Our system has been designed for scalability in terms of data size, complexity (i.e. number of modalities), and varying form factors of display environments.
Industrial cone-beam X-Ray computed tomography (CT) systems often face problems due to artifacts caused by a bad placement of the specimen on the rotary plate. This paper presents a visual-analysis tool for CT systems, which provides a simulation-based preview and estimates artifacts and deviations of a specimen's placement using the corresponding 3D geometrical surface model as input. The presented tool identifies potentially good or bad placements of a specimen and regions of a specimen, which cause the major portion of artefacts. The tool can be used for a preliminary analysis of the specimen before CT scanning, in order to determine the optimal way of placing the object. The analysis includes: penetration lengths, placement stability and an investigation in Radon space. Novel visualization techniques are applied to the simulation data. A stability widget is presented for determining the placement parameters' robustness. The performance and the comparison of results provided by the tool compared with real world data is demonstrated using two specimens.
Video storyboard, which is a form of video visualization, summarizes the major events in a video using illustrative visualization. There are three main technical challenges in creating a video storyboard, (a) event classification, (b) event selection and (c) event illustration. Among these challenges, (a) is highly application-dependent and requires a significant amount of application specific semantics to be encoded in a system or manually specified by users. This paper focuses on challenges (b) and (c). In particular, we present a framework for hierarchical event representation, and an importance-based selection algorithm for supporting the creation of a video storyboard from a video. We consider the storyboard to be an event summarization for the whole video, whilst each individual illustration on the board is also an event summarization but for a smaller time window. We utilized a 3D visualization template for depicting and annotating events in illustrations. To demonstrate the concepts and algorithms developed, we use Snooker video visualization as a case study, because it has a concrete and agreeable set of semantic definitions for events and can make use of existing techniques of event detection and 3D reconstruction in a reliable manner. Nevertheless, most of our concepts and algorithms developed for challenges (b) and (c) can be applied to other application areas.
The unguided visual exploration of volumetric data can be both a challenging and a time-consuming undertaking. Identifying a set of favorable vantage points at which to start exploratory expeditions can greatly reduce this effort and can also ensure that no important structures are being missed. Recent research efforts have focused on entropy-based viewpoint selection criteria that depend on scalar values describing the structures of interest. In contrast, we propose a viewpoint suggestion pipeline that is based on feature-clustering in high-dimensional space. We use gradient/normal variation as a metric to identify interesting local events and then cluster these via k-means to detect important salient composite features. Next, we compute the maximum possible exposure of these composite feature for different viewpoints and calculate a 2D entropy map parameterized in longitude and latitude to point out promising view orientations. Superimposed onto an interactive track-ball interface, users can then directly use this entropy map to quickly navigate to potentially interesting viewpoints where visibility-based transfer functions can be employed to generate volume renderings that minimize occlusions. To give full exploration freedom to the user, the entropy map is updated on the fly whenever a view has been selected, pointing to new and promising but so far unseen view directions. Alternatively, our system can also use a set-cover optimization algorithm to provide a minimal set of views needed to observe all features. The views so generated could then be saved into a list for further inspection or into a gallery for a summary presentation.
We present the visual analysis of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed's trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the up-stroke and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to quad wing insects.
The first half of a two-step quaternion Julia set visualization system is described. This step uses a quarternion square root function to adapt the classic inverse iteration algorithm to the quaternions. The augmented version produces a 3-D Julia set defined by a point cloud that can be interactively manipulated on a graphics workstation. Several cues are assigned to the point cloud to increase depth perception. Finally, a short theorem is proven that extends the domain of the inverse iteration method to a rotational family of quadratic quaternion Julia sets.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Describes a technique for achieving fast volume ray-casting on parallel machines, using a load-balancing scheme and an efficient pipelined approach to compositing. We propose a new model for measuring the amount of work one needs to perform in order to render a given volume, and we use this model to obtain a better load-balancing scheme for distributed memory machines. We also discuss in detail the design trade-offs of our technique. In order to validate our model, we have implemented it on the Intel iPSC/860 and the Intel Paragon, and conducted a detailed performance analysis.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this paper we introduce a new and simple algorithm to compress isosurface data. This is the data extracted by isosurface algorithms from scalar functions defined on volume grids, and used to generate polygon meshes or alternative representations. In this algorithm the mesh connectivity and a substantial proportion of the geometric information are encoded to a fraction of a bit per marching cubes vertex with a context based arithmetic coder closely related to the JBIG binary image compression standard. The remaining optional geometric information that specifies the location of each marching cubes vertex more precisely along its supporting intersecting grid edge, is efficiently encoded in scan-order with the same mechanism. Vertex normals can optionally be computed as normalized gradient vectors by the encoder and included in the bitstream after quantization and entropy encoding, or computed by the decoder in a postprocessing smoothing step. These choices are determined by trade-offs associated with an in-core vs. out-of-core decoder structure. The main features of our algorithm are its extreme simplicity and high compression rates.
We introduce a novel span-triangle data structure, based on the span-space representation for isosurfaces. It stores all necessary cell information for dynamic manipulation of the isovalue in an efficient way. We have found that using our data structure in combination with point-based techniques, implemented on graphics hardware, effects in real-time rendering and exploration. Our extraction algorithm utilizes an incremental and progressive update scheme, enabling smooth interaction without significant latency. Moreover, the corresponding visualization pipeline is capable of processing large data sets by utilizing all three levels of memory: disk, system and graphics. We address practical usability in actual medical applications, achieving a new level of interactivity.
We describe a new technique for fitting scattered point cloud data. Given a scattered point cloud of 3D data points and associated normal vectors, our new method produces an implicit volume model whose zero level isosurface interpolates the given points and associated normal vectors. We concentrate on certain application of these new volume modeling techniques. We take existing polygon mesh surfaces and use the present methods to construct implicit volume models for these surfaces. Implicit models allow for the application of Boolean operations on these surfaces through the techniques of constructive solid geometry. Also, standard wavelet and filter operators can be applied to the implicit volume model leading to effective smoothing and filtering algorithms, which are simple to implement.
We present a method for extracting boundary surfaces from segmented cross-section image data. We use a constrained Potts model to interpolate an arbitrary number of region boundaries between segmented images. This produces a segmented volume from which we extract a triangulated boundary surface using well-known marching tetrahedra methods. This surface contains staircase-like artifacts and an abundance of unnecessary triangles. We describe an approach that addresses these problems with a voxel-accurate simplification algorithm that reduces surface complexity by an order of magnitude. Our boundary interpolation and simplification methods are novel contributions to the study of surface extraction from segmented cross-sections. We have applied our method to construct polycrystal grain boundary surfaces from micrographs of a sample of the metal tantalum.
A (3D) scalar grid is a regular n<sub>1</sub>× n<sub>2</sub>× n<sub>3</sub>grid of vertices where each vertex v is associated with some scalar value s<sub>v</sub>. Applying trilinear interpolation, the scalar grid determines a scalar function g where g(v) = s<sub>v</sub>for each grid vertex v. An isosurface with isovalue σ is a triangular mesh which approximates the level set g<sup>-1</sup>(σ). The fractal dimension of an isosurface represents the growth in the isosurface as the number of grid cubes increases. We define and discuss the fractal isosurface dimension. Plotting the fractal dimension as a function of the isovalues in a data set provides information about the isosurfaces determined by the data set. We present statistics on the average fractal dimension of 60 publicly available benchmark data sets. We also show the fractal dimension is highly correlated with topological noise in the benchmark data sets, measuring the topological noise by the number of connected components in the isosurface. Lastly, we present a formula predicting the fractal dimension as a function of noise and validate the formula with experimental results.
Splatting is an object space direct volume rendering algorithm that produces images of high quality, but is computationally expensive like many other volume rendering algorithms. The paper presents a new technique that enhances the speed of splatting without trading off image quality. This new method reduces rendering time by employing a simple indexing mechanism which allows to visit and splat only the voxels of interest. It is shown that this algorithm is suitable for the dynamic situation in which viewing parameters and opacity transfer functions change interactively. We report experimental results on several test data sets of useful site and complexity, and discuss the cost/benefit trade off of our method.
Discusses the concept of uniform frequency images, which exhibit uniform local frequency properties. Such images make optimal use of space when sampled close to their Nyquist limit. A warping function may be applied to an arbitrary image to redistribute its local frequency content, reducing its highest frequencies and increasing its lowest frequencies in order to approach this uniform frequency ideal. The warped image may then be downsampled according to its new, reduced Nyquist limit, thereby reducing its storage requirements. To reconstruct the original image, the inverse warp is applied. We present a general, top-down algorithm to automatically generate a piecewise-linear warping function with this frequency balancing property for a given input image. The image size is reduced by applying the warp and then downsampling. We store this warped, downsampled image plus a small number of polygons with texture coordinates to describe the inverse warp. The original image is later reconstructed by rendering the associated polygons with the warped image applied as a texture map, a process which is easily accelerated by current graphics hardware. As compared to previous image compression techniques, we generate a similar graceful space-quality tradeoff with the advantage of being able to "uncompress" images during rendering. We report results for several images with sizes ranging from 15,000 to 300,000 pixels, achieving reduction rates of 70-90% with improved quality over downsampling alone.
Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a popular computational simulation technique used in various scientific and engineering fields. Although AMR data is organized in a hierarchical multi-resolution data structure, the traditional volume visualization algorithms such as ray-casting and splatting cannot handle the form without converting it to a sophisticated data structure. In this paper, we present a hierarchical multi-resolution splatting technique using k-d trees and octrees for AMR data that is suitable for implementation on the latest consumer PC graphics hardware. We describe a graphical user interface to set transfer function and viewing/rendering parameters interactively. Experimental results obtained on a general purpose PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce card are presented to demonstrate that the technique can interactively render AMR data (over 20 frames per second). Our scheme can easily be applied to parallel rendering of time-varying AMR data.
Typically there is a high coherence in data values between neighboring time steps in an iterative scientific software simulation; this characteristic similarly contributes to a corresponding coherence in the visibility of volume blocks when these consecutive time steps are rendered. Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical "TOC tree" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time-varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.
We present the current state of Vol-a-Tile, an interactive tool for exploring large volumetric data on scalable tiled displays. Vol-a-Tile presents a variety of features employed by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on data collected from the Anatomy of a Ridge-Axis Discontinuity seismic experiment. Hardware texture mapping and level-of-detail techniques provide interactivity. A high-performance network protocol is used to connect remote data sources over high-bandwidth photonic networks.
Traditional flow volumes construct an explicit geometrical or parametrical representation from the vector field. The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the flow volume is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying flow volume is lost in the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric flow volume is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional isocontouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed flow volume or set of flow volumes that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the flow volume. The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit flow volumes.
We describe OpenGL multipipe SDK (MPK), a toolkit for scalable parallel rendering based on OpenGL. MPK provides a uniform application programming interface (API) to manage scalable graphics applications across many different graphics subsystems. MPK-based applications run seamlessly from single-processor, single-pipe desktop systems to large multi-processor, multipipe scalable graphics systems. The application is oblivious of the system configuration, which can be specified through a configuration file at run time. To scale application performance, MPK uses a decomposition system that supports different modes for task partitioning and implements optimized CPU-based composition algorithms. MPK also provides a customizable image composition interface, which can be used to apply post-processing algorithms on raw pixel data obtained from executing sub-tasks on multiple graphics pipes in parallel. This can be used to implement parallel versions of any CPU-based algorithm, not necessarily used for rendering. In this paper, we motivate the need for a scalable graphics API and discuss the architecture of MPK. We present MPK's graphics configuration interface, introduce the notion of compound-based decomposition schemes and describe our implementation. We present some results from our work on a couple of target system architectures and conclude with future directions of research in this area.
We describe a concurrent visualization pipeline designed for operation in a production supercomputing environment. The facility was initially developed on the NASA Ames "Columbia" supercomputer for a massively parallel forecast model (GEOS4). During the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, GEOS4 was run 4 times a day under tight time constraints so that its output could be included in an ensemble prediction that was made available to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center. Given this time-critical context, we designed a configurable concurrent pipeline to visualize multiple global fields without significantly affecting the runtime model performance or reliability. We use MPEG compression of the accruing images to facilitate live low-bandwidth distribution of multiple visualization streams to remote sites. We also describe the use of our concurrent visualization framework with a global ocean circulation model, which provides a 864-fold increase in the temporal resolution of practically achievable animations. In both the atmospheric and oceanic circulation models, the application scientists gained new insights into their model dynamics, due to the high temporal resolution animations attainable
Visually assessing the effect of the coronary artery anatomy on the perfusion of the heart muscle in patients with coronary artery disease remains a challenging task. We explore the feasibility of visualizing this effect on perfusion using a numerical approach. We perform a computational simulation of the way blood is perfused throughout the myocardium purely based on information from a three-dimensional anatomical tomographic scan. The results are subsequently visualized using both three-dimensional visualizations and bullpsilas eye plots, partially inspired by approaches currently common in medical practice. Our approach results in a comprehensive visualization of the coronary anatomy that compares well to visualizations commonly used for other scanning technologies. We demonstrate techniques giving detailed insight in blood supply, coronary territories and feeding coronary arteries of a selected region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through visualizations that show information which commonly cannot be directly observed in scanning data, such as a separate visualization of the supply from each coronary artery. We thus show that the results of a computational simulation can be effectively visualized and facilitate visually correlating these results to for example perfusion data.
We present two visualization techniques for curve-centric volume reformation with the aim to create compelling comparative visualizations. A curve-centric volume reformation deforms a volume, with regards to a curve in space, to create a new space in which the curve evaluates to zero in two dimensions and spans its arc-length in the third. The volume surrounding the curve is deformed such that spatial neighborhood to the curve is preserved. The result of the curve-centric reformation produces images where one axis is aligned to arc-length, and thus allows researchers and practitioners to apply their arc-length parameterized data visualizations in parallel for comparison. Furthermore we show that when visualizing dense data, our technique provides an inside out projection, from the curve and out into the volume, which allows for inspection what is around the curve. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques in the context of two application cases. We show that existing data visualizations of arc-length parameterized data can be enhanced by using our techniques, in addition to creating a new view and perspective on volumetric data around curves. Additionally we show how volumetric data can be brought into plotting environments that allow precise readouts. In the first case we inspect streamlines in a flow field around a car, and in the second we inspect seismic volumes and well logs from drilling.
The authors present a flexible and efficient method to simulate the Doppler shift. In this new method the spectral curves of surface properties and light composition are represented by spline functions of wavelength. These functions can cover the entire electromagnetic (EM) waves bandwidth, and incorporate the thermal radiation of objects into the surface property description. In particular, a temperature-dependent emission spectral distribution can be assigned to each object for imaging the nonvisible thermal spectra which may become visible due to blue shift. The Doppler shift and shading operations are performed through the manipulation of spline coefficients. The evaluation of the spline functions, which is computationally expensive, is only carried out once-at the end of each shading loop for generating the display RGB values.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We propose a new framework for doing scientific visualization. The basis for this framework is a combination of particle systems and behavioral animation. Here, particles are not only affected by the field that they are in, but can also exhibit different programmed behaviors. An intuitive delivery system, based on virtual cans of spray paint, is also described to introduce the smart particles into the data set. Hence the name spray rendering. Using this metaphor, different types of spray paint are used to highlight different features in the data set. Spray rendering offers several advantages over existing methods: (1) it generalizes the current techniques of surface, volume and flow visualization under one coherent framework; (2) it works with regular and irregular grids as well as sparse and dense data sets; (3) it allows selective progressive refinement; (4) it is modular, extensible and provides scientists with the flexibility for exploring relationships in their data sets in natural and artistic ways.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Pseudocoloring is a frequently used technique in scientific visualization for mapping a color to a data value. When using pseudocolor and animation to visualize data that contain missing regions displayed as black or transparent, the missing regions popping in and out can distract the viewer from the more relevant information. Filling these gaps with interpolated data could lead to a misinterpretation of the data. The paper presents a method for combining pseudocoloring and grayscale in the same colormap. Valid data are mapped to colors in the colormap. The luminance values of the colors bounding areas of missing data are used in interpolating over these regions. The missing data are mapped to the grayscale portion of the colormap. This approach has the advantages of eliminating distracting gaps caused by missing data and distinguishing between those areas that represent valid data and those areas that do not. This approach was inspired by a technique used in the restoration of paintings.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In researching the communication mechanisms between cells of the immune system, visualization of proteins in three dimensions can be used to determine which proteins are capable of interacting with one another at a given time by showing their spatial colocality. Volume data sets are created using digital confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. A variety of visualization approaches are then used to examine the interactions. These include volume rendering, isosurface extraction, and virtual reality. Based on our experiences, we have concluded that no single one of these approaches provides a complete solution for visualizing biological data. However, in combination, their respective strengths complement one another to provide an understanding of the data.
The paper discusses CAVEvis and a related set of tools for the interactive visualization and exploration of large sets of time-varying scalar and vector fields using the CAVE virtual reality environment. Since visualization of large data sets can be very time-consuming in both computation and rendering time, the task is distributed over multiple machines, each of which is specialized for some aspect of the visualization process. All modules must run asynchronously to maintain the highest level of interactivity. A model of distributed visualization is introduced that addresses important issues related to the management of time-dependent data, module synchronization, and interactivity bottlenecks.
In this paper the motivation, design and application of a distributed blackboard architecture for interactive data visualization is discussed. The main advantages of the architecture are twofold. First, it allows visualization tools to be tightly integrated with simulations. Second, it allows qualitative and quantitative analysis to be combined during the visualization process.
We present a method for visualizing three dimensional vector fields which are defined on a two dimensional manifold only. These vector fields do exist in real application, as we show by an example of an optical measuring instrument which can gauge the displacement at the surface of a mechanical part. The general idea is to compute LIC textures in the manifold's tangent space and to deform the manifold according to the normal information. The resulting LIC texture is mapped onto the deformed manifold and is rendered as a three dimensional scene. Due to the light's reflection on the deformed manifold, one can interactively explore the result of the deformation.
Virtual endoscopy presents the cross-sectional acquired 3D-data of a computer tomograph as an endoluminal view. The common approach for the visualization of a virtual endoscopy is surface rendering, yielding images close to a real endoscopy. If external structures are of interest, volume rendering techniques have to be used. These methods do not display the exact shape of the inner lumen very well. For certain applications, e.g. operation planning of a transbronchial biopsy, both the shape of the inner lumen as well as outer structures like blood vessels and the tumor have to be delineated. A method is described, that allows a quick and easy hybrid visualization using overlays of different visualization methods like different surfaces or volume renderings with different transfer functions in real time on a low-end PC. To achieve real time frame rates, image based rendering techniques have been used.
We present the circular incident edge lists (CIEL), a new data structure and a high-performance algorithm for generating a series of iso-surfaces in a highly unstructured grid. Slicing-based volume rendering is also considered. The CIEL data structure represents all the combinatorial information of the grid, making it possible to optimize the classical propagation from local minima paradigm. The usual geometric structures are replaced by a more efficient combinatorial structure. An active edges list is maintained, and iteratively propagated from an iso-surface to the next one in a very efficient way. The intersected cells incident to each active edge are retrieved, and the intersection polygons are generated by circulating around their facets. This latter feature enables arbitrary irregular cells to be treated, such as those encountered in certain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Since the CIEL data structure solely depends on the connections between the cells, it is possible to take into account dynamic changes in the geometry of the mesh and in property values, which only requires the sorted extrema list to be updated. Experiments have shown that our approach is significantly faster than classical methods. The major drawback of our method is its memory consumption, higher than most classical methods. However, experimental results show that it stays within a practical range.
Novel speech and/or gesture interfaces are candidates for use in future mobile or ubiquitous applications. This paper describes an evaluation of various interfaces for visual navigation of a whole Earth 3D terrain model. A mouse driven interface, a speech interface, a gesture interface, and a multimodal speech and gesture interface were used to navigate to targets placed at various points on the Earth. This study measured each participant's recall of target identity, order, and location as a measure of cognitive load. Timing information as well as a variety of subjective measures including discomfort and user preference were taken. While the familiar and mature mouse interface scored best by most measures, the speech interface also performed well. The gesture and multimodal interface suffered from weaknesses in the gesture modality. Weaknesses in the speech and multimodal modalities are identified and areas for improvement are discussed.
We describe an interactive visualization and modeling program for the creation of protein structures "from scratch." The input to our program is an amino acid sequence - decoded from a gene - and a sequence of predicted secondary structure types for each amino acid - provided by external structure prediction programs. Our program can be used in the set-up phase of a protein structure prediction process; the structures created with it serve as input for a subsequent global internal energy minimization, or another method of protein structure prediction. Our program supports basic visualization methods for protein structures, interactive manipulation based on inverse kinematics, and visualization guides to aid a user in creating "good" initial structures.
We describe a general algorithm to produce compatible 3D triangulations from spatial decompositions. Such triangulations match edges and faces across spatial cell boundaries, solving several problems in graphics and visualization including the crack problem found in adaptive isosurface generation, triangulation of arbitrary grids (including unstructured grids), clipping, and the interval tetrahedrization problem. The algorithm produces compatible triangulations on a cell-by-cell basis, using a modified Delaunay triangulation with a simple point ordering rule to resolve degenerate cases and produce unique triangulations across cell boundaries. The algorithm is naturally parallel since it requires no neighborhood cell information, only a unique, global point numbering. We show application of this algorithm to adaptive contour generation; tetrahedrization of unstructured meshes; clipping and interval volume mesh generation.
We present a space leaping technique for accelerating volume rendering with very low space and run-time complexity. Our technique exploits the ray coherence during ray casting by using the distance a ray traverses in empty space to leap its neighboring rays. Our technique works with parallel as well as perspective volume rendering, does not require any preprocessing or 3D data structures, and is independent of the transfer function. Being an image-space technique, it is independent of the complexity of the data being rendered. It can be used to accelerate both time-coherent and noncoherent animation sequences.
Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of healthy and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.
In this work we present a hardware-accelerated direct volume rendering system for visualizing multivariate wave functions in semiconducting quantum dot (QD) simulations. The simulation data contains the probability density values of multiple electron orbitals for up to tens of millions of atoms, computed by the NEMO3-D quantum device simulator software run on large-scale cluster architectures. These atoms form two interpenetrating crystalline face centered cubic lattices (FCC), where each FCC cell comprises the eight corners of a cubic cell and six additional face centers. We have developed compact representation techniques for the FCC lattice within PC graphics hardware texture memory, hardware-accelerated linear and cubic reconstruction schemes, and new multi-field rendering techniques utilizing logarithmic scale transfer functions. Our system also enables the user to drill down through the simulation data and execute statistical queries using general-purpose computing on the GPU (GPGPU).
Navigating through large-scale virtual environments such as simulations of the astrophysical Universe is difficult. The huge spatial range of astronomical models and the dominance of empty space make it hard for users to travel across cosmological scales effectively, and the problem of wayfinding further impedes the user's ability to acquire reliable spatial knowledge of astronomical contexts. We introduce a new technique called the scalable world-in-miniature (WIM) map as a unifying interface to facilitate travel and wayfinding in a virtual environment spanning gigantic spatial scales: power-law spatial seating enables rapid and accurate transitions among widely separated regions; logarithmically mapped miniature spaces offer a global overview mode when the full context is too large; 3D landmarks represented in the WIM are enhanced by scale, positional, and directional cues to augment spatial context awareness; a series of navigation models are incorporated into the scalable WIM to improve the performance of travel tasks posed by the unique characteristics of virtual cosmic exploration. The scalable WIM user interface supports an improved physical navigation experience and assists pragmatic cognitive understanding of a visualization context that incorporates the features of large-scale astronomy
We present the results of two controlled studies comparing layered surface visualizations under various texture conditions. The task was to estimate surface normals, measured by accuracy of a hand-set surface normal probe. A single surface visualization was compared with the two-surfaces case under conditions of no texture and with projected grid textures. Variations in relative texture spacing on top and bottom surfaces were compared, as well as opacity of the top surface. Significant improvements are found for the textured cases over non-textured surfaces. Either larger or thinner top-surface textures, and lower top surface opacities are shown to give less bottom surface error. Top surface error appears to be highly resilient to changes in texture. Given the results we also present an example of how appropriate textures might be useful in volume visualization.
We describe a system for interactively rendering isosurfaces of tetrahedral finite-element scalar fields using coherent ray tracing techniques on the CPU. By employing state-of-the art methods in polygonal ray tracing, namely aggressive packet/frustum traversal of a bounding volume hierarchy, we can accommodate large and time-varying unstructured data. In conjunction with this efficiency structure, we introduce a novel technique for intersecting ray packets with tetrahedral primitives. Ray tracing is flexible, allowing for dynamic changes in isovalue and time step, visualization of multiple isosurfaces, shadows, and depth-peeling transparency effects. The resulting system offers the intuitive simplicity of isosurfacing, guaranteed-correct visual results, and ultimately a scalable, dynamic and consistently interactive solution for visualizing unstructured volumes.
Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.
In this paper we introduce a technique for applying textual labels to 3D surfaces. An effective labeling must balance the conflicting goals of conveying the shape of the surface while being legible from a range of viewing directions. Shape can be conveyed by placing the text as a texture directly on the surface, providing shape cues, meaningful landmarks and minimally obstructing the rest of the model. But rendering such surface text is problematic both in regions of high curvature, where text would be warped, and in highly occluded regions, where it would be hidden. Our approach achieves both labeling goals by applying surface labels to a psilatext scaffoldpsila, a surface explicitly constructed to hold the labels. Text scaffolds conform to the underlying surface whenever possible, but can also float above problem regions, allowing them to be smooth while still conveying the overall shape. This paper provides methods for constructing scaffolds from a variety of input sources, including meshes, constructive solid geometry, and scalar fields. These sources are first mapped into a distance transform, which is then filtered and used to construct a new mesh on which labels are either manually or automatically placed. In the latter case, annotated regions of the input surface are associated with proximal regions on the new mesh, and labels placed using cartographic principles.
Most images used in visualization are computed with the planar pinhole camera. This classic camera model has important advantages such as simplicity, which enables efficient software and hardware implementations, and similarity to the human eye, which yields images familiar to the user. However, the planar pinhole camera has only a single viewpoint, which limits images to parts of the scene to which there is direct line of sight. In this paper we introduce the curved ray camera to address the single viewpoint limitation. Rays are C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-continuous curves that bend to circumvent occluders. Our camera is designed to provide a fast 3-D point projection operation, which enables interactive visualization. The camera supports both 3-D surface and volume datasets. The camera is a powerful tool that enables seamless integration of multiple perspectives for overcoming occlusions in visualization while minimizing distortions.
This paper presents a novel framework for visualizing volumetric data specified on complex polyhedral grids, without the need to perform any kind of a priori tetrahedralization. These grids are composed of polyhedra that often are non-convex and have an arbitrary number of faces, where the faces can be non-planar with an arbitrary number of vertices. The importance of such grids in state-of-the-art simulation packages is increasing rapidly. We propose a very compact, face-based data structure for representing such meshes for visualization, called two-sided face sequence lists (TSFSL), as well as an algorithm for direct GPU-based ray-casting using this representation. The TSFSL data structure is able to represent the entire mesh topology in a 1D TSFSL data array of face records, which facilitates the use of efficient 1D texture accesses for visualization. In order to scale to large data sizes, we employ a mesh decomposition into bricks that can be handled independently, where each brick is then composed of its own TSFSL array. This bricking enables memory savings and performance improvements for large meshes. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with real-world application results, by visualizing highly complex polyhedral data from commercial state-of-the-art simulation packages.
The authors describe a conceptual model, the memory hierarchy framework, and a visual language for using the model. The model is more faithful to the structure of computers than the Von Neumann and Turing models. It addresses the issues of data movement and exposes and unifies storage mechanisms such as cache, translation lookaside buffers, main memory, and disks. The visual language presents the details of a computer's memory hierarchy in a concise drawing composed of rectangles and connecting segments. Using this framework, the authors improved the performance of a matrix multiplication algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. The framework gives insight into computer architecture and performance bottlenecks by making effective use of human visual abilities.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An algorithm that attempts to improve a triangulation by shifting the vertices so that curvature within the triangles is nearly equal is presented. Unnecessary triangles are removed. The method is an effective way of guaranteeing that the triangle vertices are points of higher curvature, and that the triangle edges correspond to distinctive edges on the surfaces. Triangulations of surfaces with constant curvature-and hence no distinctive features-will gain nothing from this or any other optimization algorithm. As demonstrated by the results, the techinque of moving triangle vertices can improve some triangulation models. Greatest improvements occur with surfaces characterized by sharp edges, such as the pyramid and ridge models. Less improvement occurs on models that already approximate the surface topology and/or have less distinctive features.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper addresses multiresolutional representation of datasets arising from a computational field simulation. The approach determines the regions of interest, breaks the volume into variable size blocks to localize the information, and then codes each block using a wavelet transform. The blocks are then ranked by visual information content so that the most informative wavelet coefficients can be embedded in a bit stream for progressive transmission or access. The technique is demonstrated on a widely-used computational field simulation dataset.
This paper discusses techniques for visualizing structure in video data and other data sets that represent time snapshots of physical phenomena. Individual frames of a movie are treated as vectors and projected onto a low-dimensional subspace spanned by principal components. Movies can be compared and their differences visualized by analyzing the nature of the subspace and the projections of multiple movies onto the same subspace. The approach is demonstrated on an application in neurobiology in which the electrical response of a visual cortex to optical stimulation is imaged onto a high-speed photodiode array to produce a cortical movie. Techniques for sampling movies over a single trial and multiple trials are discussed. The approach provides the traditional benefits of principal component analysis (compression, noise reduction and classification) and also allows the visual separation of spatial and temporal behavior.
Medical image analysis is shifting from current film oriented light screen environments to computer environments that involve viewing and analyzing large sets of images on a computer screen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, in particular, can involve many images. The paper examines how best to meet the needs of radiologists in a computational environment. To this end, a field study was conducted to observe radiologists' interactions during MRI analysis in the traditional light screen environment. Key issues uncovered involve control over focus and context, dynamic grouping of images and retrieval of images and image groups. To address the problem of focus and context, existing layout adjustment and magnification techniques are explored to provide the most appropriate solution. Our interest is in combining the methodologies of human computer interaction studies with computational presentation possibilities to design a visual environment for the crucial field of medical image analysis.
This case study describes a technique for the three-dimensional analysis of the internal microscopic structure (microstructure) of materials. This technique consists of incrementally polishing through a thin layer (approximately 0.2 /spl mu/m) of material, chemically etching the polished surface, applying reference marks, and performing optical or scanning electron microscopy on selected areas. The series of images are then processed employing AVS and other visualization software to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the material. We describe how we applied this technique to an alloy steel to study the morphology, connectivity, and distribution of cementite precipitates formed during thermal processing. The results showed microstructural features not previously identified with traditional 2D techniques.
We present a novel approach to solving the cracking problem. The cracking problem arises in many contexts in scientific visualization and computer graphics modeling where there is need for an approximation based upon domain decomposition that is fine in certain regions and coarse in others. This includes surface rendering approximation of images and multiresolution terrain visualization. In general, algorithms based upon adaptive refinement strategies must deal with this problem. The approach presented here is simple and general. It is based upon the use of a triangular Coons patch. Both the basic idea of using a triangular Coons patch in this context and the particular Coons patch that is used constitute the novel contributions of the paper.
A standard way to segment medical imaging datasets is by tracing contours around regions of interest in parallel planar slices. Unfortunately, the standard methods for reconstructing three dimensional surfaces from those planar contours tend to be either complicated or not very robust. Furthermore, they fail to consistently mesh abutting structures which share portions of contours. We present a novel, straight-forward algorithm for accurately and automatically reconstructing surfaces from planar contours. Our algorithm is based on scanline rendering and separating surface extraction. By rendering the contours as distinctly colored polygons and reading back each rendered slice into a segmented volume, we reduce the complex problem of building a surface from planar contours to the much simpler problem of extracting separating surfaces from a classified volume. Our scanline surfacing algorithm robustly handles complex surface topologies such as bifurcations, embedded features and abutting surfaces.
The study of time dependent characteristics of proteins is important for gaining insight into many biological processes. However, visualizing protein dynamics by animating atom trajectories does not provide satisfactory results. When the trajectory is sampled with large times steps, the impression of smooth motion will be destroyed due to the effects of temporal aliasing. Sampling with small time steps will result in the camouflage of interesting motions. In this case study, we discuss techniques for the interactive 3D visualization of the dynamics of the photoactive yellow protein. We use essential dynamics methods to filter out uninteresting atom motions from the larger concerted motions. In this way, clear and concise 3D animations of protein motions can be produced. In addition, we discuss various interactive techniques that allow exploration of the essential subspace of the protein. We discuss the merits of these techniques when applied to the analysis of the yellow protein.
The analysis of multidimensional functions is important in many engineering disciplines, and poses a major problem as the number of dimensions increases. Previous visualization approaches focus on representing three or fewer dimensions at a time. This paper presents a new focus+context visualization that provides an integrated overview of an entire multidimensional function space, with uniform treatment of all dimensions. The overview is displayed with respect to a user-controlled polar focal point in the function's parameter space. Function value patterns are viewed along rays that emanate from the focal point in all directions in the parameter space, and represented radially around the focal point in the visualization. Data near the focal point receives proportionally more screen space than distant data. This approach scales smoothly from two dimensions to 10-20, with a 1000 pixel range on each dimension.
Many of us working in visualization have our own list of our top 5 or 10 unresolved problems in visualization. We have assembled a group of panelists to debate and perhaps reach concensus on the top problems in visualization that still need to be explored. We include panelists from both the information and scientific visualization domains. After our presentations, we encourage interaction with the audience to see if we can further formulate and perhaps finalize our list of top unresolved problems in visualization.
This paper presents a novel method for computing simulated x-ray images, or DRRs (digitally reconstructed radiographs), of tetrahedral meshes with higher-order attenuation functions. DRRs are commonly used in computer assisted surgery (CAS), with the attenuation function consisting of a voxelized CT study, which is viewed from different directions. Our application of DRRs is in intra-operative "2D-3D" registration, i.e., finding the pose of the CT dataset given a small number of patient radiographs. We register 2D patient images with a statistical tetrahedral model, which encodes the CT intensity numbers as Bernstein polynomials, and includes knowledge about typical shape variation modes. The unstructured grid is more suitable for applying deformations than a rectilinear grid, and the higher-order polynomials provide a better approximation of the actual density than constant or linear models. The infra-operative environment demands a fast method for creating the DRRs, which we present here. We demonstrate this application through the creation and use of a deformable atlas of human pelvis bones. Compared with other works on rendering unstructured grids, the main contributions of this work are: 1) Simple and perspective-correct interpolation of the thickness of a tetrahedral cell. 2) Simple and perspective-correct interpolation of front and back barycentric coordinates with respect to the cell. 3) Computing line integrals of higher-order functions. 4) Capability of applying shape deformations and variations in the attenuation function without significant performance loss. The method does not depend on for pre-integration, and does not require depth-sorting of the visualized cells. We present imaging and timing results of implementing the algorithm, and discuss the impact of using higher-order functions on the quality of the result and the performance.
In the past decade, a lot of research work has been conducted to support collaborative visualization among remote users over the networks, allowing them to visualize and manipulate shared data for problem solving. There are many applications of collaborative visualization, such as oceanography, meteorology and medical science. To facilitate user interaction, a critical system requirement for collaborative visualization is to ensure that remote users would perceive a synchronized view of the shared data. Failing this requirement, the user's ability in performing the desirable collaborative tasks would be affected. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method to support collaborative visualization. It considers how interaction with dynamic objects is perceived by application participants under the existence of network latency, and remedies the motion trajectory of the dynamic objects. It also handles the false positive and false negative collision detection problems. The new method is particularly well designed for handling content changes due to unpredictable user interventions or object collisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a number of experiments
We present an evaluation of a parameterized set of 2D icon-based visualization methods where we quantified how perceptual interactions among visual elements affect effective data exploration. During the experiment, subjects quantified three different design factors for each method: the spatial resolution it could represent, the number of data values it could display at each point, and the degree to which it is visually linear. The class of visualization methods includes Poisson-disk distributed icons where icon size, icon spacing, and icon brightness can be set to a constant or coupled to data values from a 2D scalar field. By only coupling one of those visual components to data, we measured filtering interference for all three design factors. Filtering interference characterizes how different levels of the constant visual elements affect the evaluation of the data-coupled element. Our novel experimental methodology allowed us to generalize this perceptual information, gathered using ad-hoc artificial datasets, onto quantitative rules for visualizing real scientific datasets. This work also provides a framework for evaluating visualizations of multi-valued data that incorporate additional visual cues, such as icon orientation or color
This paper describes GL4D, an interactive system for visualizing 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds embedded in four Euclidean dimensions and illuminated by 4D light sources. It is a tetrahedron-based rendering pipeline that projects geometry into volume images, an exact parallel to the conventional triangle-based rendering pipeline for 3D graphics. Novel features include GPU-based algorithms for real-time 4D occlusion handling and transparency compositing; we thus enable a previously impossible level of quality and interactivity for exploring lit 4D objects. The 4D tetrahedrons are stored in GPU memory as vertex buffer objects, and the vertex shader is used to perform per-vertex 4D modelview transformations and 4D-to-3D projection. The geometry shader extension is utilized to slice the projected tetrahedrons and rasterize the slices into individual 2D layers of voxel fragments. Finally, the fragment shader performs per-voxel operations such as lighting and alpha blending with previously computed layers. We account for 4D voxel occlusion along the 4D-to-3D projection ray by supporting a multi-pass back-to-front fragment composition along the projection ray; to accomplish this, we exploit a new adaptation of the dual depth peeling technique to produce correct volume image data and to simultaneously render the resulting volume data using 3D transfer functions into the final 2D image. Previous CPU implementations of the rendering of 4D-embedded 3-manifolds could not perform either the 4D depth-buffered projection or manipulation of the volume-rendered image in real-time; in particular, the dual depth peeling algorithm is a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 4D depth-buffering problem. GL4D is implemented as an integrated OpenGL-style API library, so that the underlying shader operations are as transparent as possible to the user.
Volume ray-casting with a higher order reconstruction filter and/or a higher sampling rate has been adopted in direct volume rendering frameworks to provide a smooth reconstruction of the volume scalar and/or to reduce artifacts when the combined frequency of the volume and transfer function is high. While it enables high-quality volume rendering, it cannot support interactive rendering due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast high-quality volume ray-casting algorithm which effectively increases the sampling rate. While a ray traverses the volume, intensity values are uniformly reconstructed using a high-order convolution filter. Additional samplings, referred to as virtual samplings, are carried out within a ray segment from a cubic spline curve interpolating those uniformly reconstructed intensities. These virtual samplings are performed by evaluating the polynomial function of the cubic spline curve via simple arithmetic operations. The min max blocks are refined accordingly for accurate empty space skipping in the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, also exploiting fast cubic texture filtering supported by programmable GPUs, offers renderings as good as a conventional ray-casting algorithm using high-order reconstruction filtering at the same sampling rate, while delivering 2.5x to 3.3x rendering speed-up.
Asymmetric tensor field visualization can provide important insight into fluid flows and solid deformations. Existing techniques for asymmetric tensor fields focus on the analysis, and simply use evenly-spaced hyperstreamlines on surfaces following eigenvectors and dual-eigenvectors in the tensor field. In this paper, we describe a hybrid visualization technique in which hyperstreamlines and elliptical glyphs are used in real and complex domains, respectively. This enables a more faithful representation of flow behaviors inside complex domains. In addition, we encode tensor magnitude, an important quantity in tensor field analysis, using the density of hyperstreamlines and sizes of glyphs. This allows colors to be used to encode other important tensor quantities. To facilitate quick visual exploration of the data from different viewpoints and at different resolutions, we employ an efficient image-space approach in which hyperstreamlines and glyphs are generated quickly in the image plane. The combination of these techniques leads to an efficient tensor field visualization system for domain scientists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization technique through applications to complex simulated engine fluid flow and earthquake deformation data. Feedback from domain expert scientists, who are also co-authors, is provided.
The problems and advantages of integrating scientific computations and visualization into one common program system are examined. An important point is the direct feedback of information from the visualization into an ongoing simulation. Some strong and weak points of the varying approaches in different software packages are shown. The visualization component of the authors' program system and the advantages of its integration into the overall system are explained. The weak points in their system and the work remaining to deal with them are described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Surface-based rendering techniques, particularly those that extract a polygonal approximation of an isosurface, are widely used in volume visualization. As dataset size increases though, the computational demands of these methods can overwhelm typically available computing resources. Recent work on accelerating such techniques has focused on preprocessing the volume data or postprocessing the extracted polygonization. The algorithm presented, concentrates instead on streamlining the surface extraction process itself so as to accelerate the rendering of large volumes. The technique shortens the conventional isosurface visualization pipeline by eliminating the intermediate polygonization. We compute the contribution of the isosurface within a volume cell to the resulting image directly from a simplified numerical description of the cell/surface intersection. The approach also reduces the work in the remaining stages of the visualization process. By quantizing the volume data, we exploit precomputed and cached data at key processing steps to improve rendering efficiency. The resulting implementation provides comparatively fast renderings with reasonable image quality.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Wavelet transforms include data decompositions and reconstructions. This paper is concerned with the authenticity issues of the data decomposition, particularly for data visualization. A total of six datasets are used to clarify the approximation characteristics of compactly supported orthogonal wavelets. We present an error tracking mechanism, which uses the available wavelet resources to measure the quality of the wavelet approximations.
Studies the topology of 2nd-order symmetric tensor fields. Degenerate points are basic constituents of tensor fields. From the set of degenerate points, an experienced researcher can reconstruct a whole tensor field. We address the conditions for the existence of degenerate points and, based on these conditions, we predict the distribution of degenerate points inside the field. Every tensor can be decomposed into a deviator and an isotropic tensor. A deviator determines the properties of a tensor field, while the isotropic part provides a uniform bias. Deviators can be 3D or locally 2D. The triple-degenerate points of a tensor field are associated with the singular points of its deviator and the double-degenerate points of a tensor field have singular local 2D deviators. This provides insights into the similarity of topological structure between 1st-order (or vectors) and 2nd-order tensors. Control functions are in charge of the occurrences of a singularity of a deviator. These singularities can further be linked to important physical properties of the underlying physical phenomena. For a deformation tensor in a stationary flow, the singularities of its deviator actually represent the area of the vortex core in the field; for a stress tensor, the singularities represent the area with no stress; for a Newtonian flow, compressible flow and incompressible flow as well as stress and deformation tensors share similar topological features due to the similarity of their deviators; for a viscous flow, removing the large, isotropic pressure contribution dramatically enhances the anisotropy due to viscosity.
This paper describes a novel rendering technique for special relativistic visualization. It is an image-based method which allows to render high speed flights through real-world scenes filmed by a standard camera. The relativistic effects on image generation are determined by the relativistic aberration of light, the Doppler effect, and the searchlight effect. These account for changes of apparent geometry, color and brightness of the objects. It is shown how the relativistic effects can be taken into account by a modification of the plenoptic function. Therefore, all known image-based nonrelativistic rendering methods can easily be extended to incorporate relativistic rendering. Our implementation allows interactive viewing of relativistic panoramas and the production of movies which show super-fast travel. Examples in the form of snapshots and film sequences are included.
We present a new algorithm for extracting adaptive multiresolution triangle meshes from volume datasets. The algorithm guarantees that the topological genus of the generated mesh is the same as the genus of the surface embedded in the volume dataset at all levels of detail. In addition to this "hard constraint" on the genus of the mesh, the user can choose to specify some number of soft geometric constraints, such as triangle aspect ratio, minimum or maximum total number of vertices, minimum and/or maximum triangle edge lengths, maximum magnitude of various error metrics per triangle or vertex, including maximum curvature (area) error, maximum distance to the surface, and others. The mesh extraction process is fully automatic and does not require manual adjusting of parameters to produce the desired results as long as the user does not specify incompatible constraints. The algorithm robustly handles special topological cases, such as trimmed surfaces (intersections of the surface with the volume boundary), and manifolds with multiple disconnected components (several closed surfaces embedded in the same volume dataset). The meshes may self-intersect at coarse resolutions. However, the self-intersections are corrected automatically as the resolution of the meshes increase. We show several examples of meshes extracted from complex volume datasets.
Polygonal approximations of isosurfaces extracted from uniformly sampled volumes are increasing in size due to the availability of higher resolution imaging techniques. The large number of I primitives represented hinders the interactive exploration of the dataset. Though many solutions have been proposed to this problem, many require the creation of isosurfaces at multiple resolutions or the use of additional data structures, often hierarchical, to represent the volume. We propose a technique for adaptive isosurface extraction that is easy to implement and allows the user to decide the degree of adaptivity as well as the choice of isosurface extraction algorithm. Our method optimizes the extraction of the isosurface by warping the volume. In a warped volume, areas of importance (e.g. containing significant details) are inflated while unimportant ones are contracted. Once the volume is warped, any extraction algorithm can be applied. The extracted mesh is subsequently unwarped such that the warped areas are rescaled to their initial proportions. The resulting isosurface is represented by a mesh that is more densely sampled in regions decided as important.
A common deficiency of discretized datasets is that detail beyond the resolution of the dataset has been irrecoverably lost. This lack of detail becomes immediately apparent once one attempts to zoom into the dataset and only recovers blur. We describe a method that generates the missing detail from any available and plausible high-resolution data, using texture synthesis. Since the detail generation process is guided by the underlying image or volume data and is designed to fill in plausible detail in accordance with the coarse structure and properties of the zoomed-in neighborhood, we refer to our method as constrained texture synthesis. Regular zooms become "semantic zooms", where each level of detail stems from a data source attuned to that resolution. We demonstrate our approach by a medical application - the visualization of a human liver - but its principles readily apply to any scenario, as long as data at all resolutions are available. We first present a 2D viewing application, called the "virtual microscope", and then extend our technique to 3D volumetric viewing.
High resolution volumes require high precision compositing to preserve detailed structures. This is even more desirable for volumes with high dynamic range values. After the high precision intermediate image has been computed, simply rounding up pixel values to regular display scales loses the computed details. In this paper, we present a novel high dynamic range volume visualization method for rendering volume data with both high spatial and intensity resolutions. Our method performs high precision volume rendering followed by dynamic tone mapping to preserve details on regular display devices. By leveraging available high dynamic range image display algorithms, this dynamic tone mapping can be automatically adjusted to enhance selected features for the final display. We also present a novel transfer function design interface with nonlinear magnification of the density range and logarithmic scaling of the color/opacity range to facilitate high dynamic range volume visualization. By leveraging modern commodity graphics hardware and out-of-core acceleration, our system can produce an effective visualization of huge volume data.
The implementation of truly interactive volume visualization and terrain rendering algorithms on the Princeton Engine (PE) video supercomputer is described. The PE is a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) computer. Since it was originally developed as a real-time digital television system simulator, it possesses many of the attributes necessary for interactive visualization: high-resolution displays, high-bandwidth I/O, supercomputer class computational performance, and a local memory array large enough to store multiple Landsat scenes and data volumes. It is shown that it is possible to generate truly interactive terrain rendering and volume visualization by computing images in real-time, at multiple frames/second.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Human beings find it difficult to analyze local and global oligonucleotide patterns in the linear primary sequences of a genome. In this paper, we present a family of iterated function systems (IFS) that can be used to generate a set of visual models of a DNA sequence. A new visualization function, the W-curve, that is derived from this IFS family is introduced. Using W-curves, a user can readily compare subsequences within a long genomic sequence - or between genomic sequences - and can visually evaluate the effect of local variations (mutations) upon the global genomic information content.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper describes the Field Encapsulation Library (FEL), which provides a grid independent application programmer's interface to gridded three dimensional field data. The C++ implementation of FEL is described, stressing the way in which the class hierarchy hides the underlying grid structure in a way that allows visualization algorithms to be written in a completely grid independent manner. Appropriately defined coordinate classes play an important role in providing this grid independence. High performance point location routines for data access are described and performance times are provided.
Large simulation grids and multi-grid configurations impose many constraints on commercial visualization software. When available RAM is limited and graphics primitives are numbered in millions, alternative techniques for data access and processing are necessary. In this case study, we present our contributions to a visualization environment based on the AVS/Express software. We demonstrate how the efficient visualization of large datasets relies upon several forms of resource sharing, and alternate and efficient data access techniques.
Throughout the design cycle, visualization, whether a sketch scribbled on the back of a spare piece of paper or a fully detailed drawing, has been the mainstay of design: we need to see the product. One of the most important stages of the design cycle is the initial, or concept, stage and it is here that design variants occur in large numbers to be vetted quickly. At this initial stage the human element, the designer is crucial to the success of the product. We describe an interactive environment for concept design which recognises the needs of the designer, not only to see the product and make rapid modifications, but also to monitor the progress of their design towards some preferred solution. This leads to the notion of a design parameter space, typically high-dimensional, which must also be visualized in addition to the product itself. Using a module developed for IRIS Explorer design steering is presented as a navigation of this space in order to search for optimal designs, either manually or by local optimisation.
In this paper, we address the problem of automatic camera positioning and automatic camera path generation in the context of historical data visualization. After short description of the given data, we elaborate on the constraints for the positioning of a virtual camera in such a way that not only the projected area is maximized, but also the depth of the displayed scene. This is especially important when displaying terrain models, which do not provide good 3D impression when only the projected area is maximized. Based on this concept, we present a method for computing an optimal camera position for each instant of time. Since the explored data are not static, but change depending on the explored scene time, we also discuss a method for animation generation. In order to avoid sudden changes of the camera position, when the previous method is applied for each frame (point in time), we introduce pseudo-events in time, which expand the bounding box defined by the currently active events of interest. In particular, this technique allows events happening in a future point in time to be taken into account such that when this time becomes current, all events of interest are already within the current viewing frustum of the camera.
The extraction of planar sections from volume images is the most commonly used technique for inspecting and visualizing anatomic structures. We propose to generalize the concept of planar section to the extraction of curved cross-sections (free form surfaces). Compared with planar slices, curved cross-sections may easily follow the trajectory of tubular structures and organs such as the aorta or the colon. They may be extracted from a 3D volume, displayed as a 3D view and possibly flattened. Flattening of curved cross-sections allows to inspect spatially complex relationship between anatomic structures and their neighborhood. They also allow to carry out measurements along a specific orientation. For the purpose of facilitating the interactive specification of free form surfaces, users may navigate in real time within the body and select the slices on which the surface control points will be positioned. Immediate feedback is provided by displaying boundary curves as cylindrical markers within a 3D view composed of anatomic organs, planar slices and possibly free form surface sections. Extraction of curved surface sections is an additional service that is available online as a Java applet (http://visiblehuman.epfl.ch). It may be used as an advanced tool for exploring and teaching anatomy.
Understanding the structure of microvasculature structures and their relationship to cells in biological tissue is an important and complex problem. Brain microvasculature in particular is known to play an important role in chronic diseases. However, these networks are only visible at the microscopic level and can span large volumes of tissue. Due to recent advances in microscopy, large volumes of data can be imaged at the resolution necessary to reconstruct these structures. Due to the dense and complex nature of microscopy data sets, it is important to limit the amount of information displayed. In this paper, we describe methods for encoding the unique structure of microvascular data, allowing researchers to selectively explore microvascular anatomy. We also identify the queries most useful to researchers studying microvascular and cellular relationships. By associating cellular structures with our microvascular framework, we allow researchers to explore interesting anatomical relationships in dense and complex data sets.
With recent advances in the measurement technology for allsky astrophysical imaging, our view of the sky is no longer limited to the tiny visible spectral range over the 2D Celestial sphere. We now can access a third dimension corresponding to a broad electromagnetic spectrum with a wide range of allsky surveys; these surveys span frequency bands including long long wavelength radio, microwaves, very short X-rays, and gamma rays. These advances motivate us to study and examine multiwavelength visualization techniques to maximize our capabilities to visualize and exploit these informative image data sets. In this work, we begin with the processing of the data themselves, uniformizing the representations and units of raw data obtained from varied detector sources. Then we apply tools to map, convert, color-code, and format the multiwavelength data in forms useful for applications. We explore different visual representations for displaying the data, including such methods as textured image stacks, the horseshoe representation, and GPU-based volume visualization. A family of visual tools and analysis methods are introduced to explore the data, including interactive data mapping on the graphics processing unit (GPU), the mini-map explorer, and GPU-based interactive feature analysis.
Study of symmetric or repeating patterns in scalar fields is important in scientific data analysis because it gives deep insights into the properties of the underlying phenomenon. Though geometric symmetry has been well studied within areas like shape processing, identifying symmetry in scalar fields has remained largely unexplored due to the high computational cost of the associated algorithms. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for detecting symmetric patterns in a scalar field distribution by analysing the topology of level sets of the scalar field. Our algorithm computes the contour tree of a given scalar field and identifies subtrees that are similar. We define a robust similarity measure for comparing subtrees of the contour tree and use it to group similar subtrees together. Regions of the domain corresponding to subtrees that belong to a common group are extracted and reported to be symmetric. Identifying symmetry in scalar fields finds applications in visualization, data exploration, and feature detection. We describe two applications in detail: symmetry-aware transfer function design and symmetry-aware isosurface extraction.
The authors describe several dynamic graphics tools for visualizing network data involving statistics associated with the nodes or links in a network. The authors suggest a number of ideas for the static display of network data, while motivating the need for interaction through dynamic graphics. A brief discussion of dynamic graphics in general is presented. The authors specialize this to the case of network data. An example is presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Television coverage of golf fails to bring the viewer an appreciation of the complex topography of a golf green and how that topography affects the putting of golf balls. A computer graphics simulation that enhances the viewer's perception of these features using shaded polygonal models of the actual golf green used in tournaments is presented. Mathematical modeling of the golf ball's trajectory on its way toward the hole further enhances viewer understanding. A putting difficulty map assesses the relative difficulty of putting from each location on the green to a given pin position. The object-oriented system is written in C and runs on a variety of 3D graphics workstations. As an experiment, the system was used at a professional golf tournament and correctly simulated all putts during the final round.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A project in the field of computational electrocardiography which requires visualization of complex, three-dimensional geometry and electric potential and current fields is described. Starting from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from a healthy subject, a multisurfaced model of the human thorax was constructed and used as the basis for computational studies relating potential distributions measured from the surface of the heart to potentials and currents throughout the volume of the thorax (a form of the forward problem in electrocardiography). Both interactive and batch-mode graphics programs were developed to view, manipulate, and interactively edit the model geometry. Results are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
It is suggested that many existing platforms over emphasize ease-of-use and do not adequately address issues of extensibility. A visualization testbed, called SuperGlue, which is particularly suited for the rapid development of new visualization methods, was built. An interpreter supports rapid development of new code, and an extensive class hierarchy encourages code reuse. By explicitly designing for ease of programming, it was possible to produce a visualization system which is powerful, easy to use, and rapidly improving. The motivation of the work, the architecture of the system, and plans for further development are reported.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Presents a novel volume rendering method which offers high rendering speed on standard workstations. It is based on a lossy data compression scheme which drastically reduces the memory bandwidth and computing requirements of perspective raycasting. Starting from classified and shaded data sets, we use block truncation coding or color cell compression to compress a block of 12 voxels into 32 bits. All blocks of the data set are processed redundantly, yielding a data structure which avoids multiple memory accesses per raypoint. As a side effect, the tri-linear interpolation of data coded in such a way is very much simplified. These techniques allow us to perform walkthroughs at interactive frame rates. Furthermore, the algorithm provides depth-cueing and the semi-transparent display of different materials. The algorithm achieves a sustained frame generation rate of about 2 Hz for large data sets (/spl sim/200/sup 3/) at an acceptable image quality on an SGI Indy workstation. A number of examples are shown.
We are interested in feature extraction from volume data in terms of coherent surfaces and 3D space curves. The input can be an inaccurate scalar or vector field, sampled densely or sparsely on a regular 3D grid, in which poor resolution and the presence of spurious noisy samples make traditional iso-surface techniques inappropriate. In this paper, we present a general-purpose methodology to extract surfaces or curves from a digital 3D potential vector field {(s,v~)}, in which each voxel holds a scalar s designating the strength and a vector v~ indicating the direction. For scalar, sparse or low-resolution data, we "vectorize" and "densify" the volume by tensor voting to produce dense vector fields that are suitable as input to our algorithms, the extremal surface and curve algorithms. Both algorithms extract, with sub-voxel precision, coherent features representing local extrema in the given vector field. These coherent features are a hole-free triangulation mesh (in the surface case), and a set of connected, oriented and non-intersecting polyline segments (in the curve case). We demonstrate the general usefulness of both extremal algorithms on a variety of real data by properly extracting their inherent extremal properties, such as (a) shock waves induced by abrupt velocity or direction changes in a flow field, (b) interacting vortex cores and vorticity lines in a velocity field, (c) crest-lines and ridges implicit in a digital terrain map, and (d) grooves, anatomical lines and complex surfaces from noisy dental data.
The paper describes new techniques for minimally immersive visualization of 3D scalar and vector fields, and visualization of document corpora. In our glyph based visualization system, the user interacts with the 3D volume of glyphs using a pair of button-enhanced 3D position and orientation trackers. The user may also examine the volume using an interactive lens, which is a rectangle that slices through the 3D volume and displays scalar information on its surface. A lens allows the display of scalar data in the 3D volume using a contour diagram, and a texture based volume rendering.
We present an algorithm for automatically classifying the interior and exterior parts of a polygonal model. The need for visualizing the interiors of objects frequently arises in medical visualization and CAD modeling. The goal of such visualizations is to display the model in a way that the human observer can easily understand the relationship between the different parts of the surface. While there exist excellent methods for visualizing surfaces that are inside one another (nested surfaces), the determination of which parts of the surface are interior is currently done manually. Our automatic method for interior classification takes a sampling approach using a collection of direction vectors. Polygons are said to be interior to the model if they are not visible in any of these viewing directions from a point outside the model. Once we have identified polygons as being inside or outside the model, these can be textured or have different opacities applied to them so that the whole model can be rendered in a more comprehensible manner. An additional consideration for some models is that they may have holes or tunnels running through them that are connected to the exterior surface. Although an external observer can see into these holes, it is often desirable to mark the walls of such tunnels as being part of the interior of a model. In order to allow this modified classification of the interior, we use morphological operators to close all the holes of the model. An input model is used together with its closed version to provide a better classification of the portions of the original model.
The visualization of scalar functions of two variables is a classic and ubiquitous application. We present a new method to visualize such data. The method is based on a nonlinear mapping of the function to a height field, followed by visualization as a shaded mountain landscape. The method is easy to implement and efficient, and leads to intriguing and insightful images: The visualization is enriched by adding ridges. Three types of applications are discussed: visualization of iso-levels, clusters (multivariate data visualization), and dense contours (flow visualization).
LightKit is a system for lighting three-dimensional synthetic scenes. LightKit simplifies the task of producing visually pleasing, easily interpretable images for visualization while making it harder to produce results where the scene illumination distracts from the visualization process. LightKit is based on lighting designs developed by artists and photographers and shown in previous studies to enhance shape perception. A key light provides natural overhead illumination of the scene, augmented by fill, head, and back lights. By default, lights are attached to a normalized, subject-centric, camera-relative coordinate frame to ensure consistent lighting independent of camera location or orientation. This system allows all lights to be positioned by specifying just six parameters. The intensity of each light is specified as a ratio to the key light intensity, allowing the scene's brightness to be adjusted using a single parameter. The color of each light is specified by a single normalized color parameter called warmth that is based on color temperature of natural sources. LightKit's default values for light position, intensity, and color are chosen to produce good results for a variety of scenes. LightKit is designed to work with both hardware graphics systems and, potentially, higher quality off-line rendering systems. We provide examples of images created using a LightKit implementation within the VTK visualization toolkit software framework.
This paper introduces a method for converting an image or volume sampled on a regular grid into a space-efficient irregular point hierarchy. The conversion process retains the original frequency characteristics of the dataset by matching the spatial distribution of sample points with the required frequency. To achieve good blending, the spherical points commonly used in volume rendering are generalized to ellipsoidal point primitives. A family of multiresolution, oriented Gabor wavelets provide the frequency-space analysis of the dataset. The outcome of this frequency analysis is the reduced set of points, in which the sampling rate is decreased in originally oversampled areas. During rendering, the traversal of the hierarchy can be controlled by any suitable error metric or quality criteria. The local level of refinement is also sensitive to the transfer function. Areas with density ranges mapped to high transfer function variability are rendered at higher point resolution than others. Our decomposition is flexible and can be used for iso-surface rendering, alpha compositing and X-ray rendering of volumes. We demonstrate our hierarchy with an interactive splatting volume renderer, in which the traversal of the point hierarchy for rendering is modulated by a user-specified frame rate.
Computational simulation of time-varying physical processes is of fundamental importance for many scientific and engineering applications. Most frequently, time-varying simulations are performed over multiple spatial grids at discrete points in time. We investigate a new approach to time-varying simulation: spacetime discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The result of this simulation method is a simplicial tessellation of spacetime with per-element polynomial solutions for physical quantities such as strain, stress, and velocity. To provide accurate visualizations of the resulting solutions, we have developed a method for per-pixel evaluation of solution data on the GPU. We demonstrate the importance of per-pixel rendering versus simple linear interpolation for producing high quality visualizations. We also show that our system can accommodate reasonably large datasets - spacetime meshes containing up to 20 million tetrahedra are not uncommon in this domain.
We present a cluster-based volume rendering system for roaming very large volumes. This system allows to move a gigabyte-sized probe inside a total volume of several tens or hundreds of gigabytes in real-time. While the size of the probe is limited by the total amount of texture memory on the cluster, the size of the total data set has no theoretical limit. The cluster is used as a distributed graphics processing unit that both aggregates graphics power and graphics memory. A hardware-accelerated volume renderer runs in parallel on the cluster nodes and the final image compositing is implemented using a pipelined sort-last rendering algorithm. Meanwhile, volume bricking and volume paging allow efficient data caching. On each rendering node, a distributed hierarchical cache system implements a global software-based distributed shared memory on the cluster. In case of a cache miss, this system first checks page residency on the other cluster nodes instead of directly accessing local disks. Using two gigabit Ethernet network interfaces per node, we accelerate data fetching by a factor of 4 compared to directly accessing local disks. The system also implements asynchronous disk access and texture loading, which makes it possible to overlap data loading, volume slicing and rendering for optimal volume roaming
We propose an out-of-core method for creating semi-regular surface representations from large input surface meshes. Our approach is based on a streaming implementation of the MAPS remesher of Lee et al. Our remeshing procedure consists of two stages. First, a simplification process is used to obtain the base domain. During simplification, we maintain the mapping information between the input and the simplified meshes. The second stage of remeshing uses the mapping information to produce samples of the output semi-regular mesh. The out-of-core operation of our method is enabled by the synchronous streaming of a simplified mesh and the mapping information stored at the original vertices. The synchronicity of two streaming buffers is maintained using a specially designed write strategy for each buffer. Experimental results demonstrate the remeshing performance of the proposed method, as well as other applications that use the created mapping between the simplified and the original surface representations
Volume exploration is an important issue in scientific visualization. Research on volume exploration has been focused on revealing hidden structures in volumetric data. While the information of individual structures or features is useful in practice, spatial relations between structures are also important in many applications and can provide further insights into the data. In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement. We also introduce a quality assessment scheme which evaluates the perception of spatial relations in the rendered images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the practical use of our system in exploratory visualization.
We extend direct volume rendering with a unified model for generalized isosurfaces, also called interval volumes, allowing a wider spectrum of visual classification. We generalize the concept of scale-invariant opacity-typical for isosurface rendering-to semi-transparent interval volumes. Scale-invariant rendering is independent of physical space dimensions and therefore directly facilitates the analysis of data characteristics. Our model represents sharp isosurfaces as limits of interval volumes and combines them with features of direct volume rendering. Our objective is accurate rendering, guaranteeing that all isosurfaces and interval volumes are visualized in a crack-free way with correct spatial ordering. We achieve simultaneous direct and interval volume rendering by extending preintegration and explicit peak finding with data-driven splitting of ray integration and hybrid computation in physical and data domains. Our algorithm is suitable for efficient parallel processing for interactive applications as demonstrated by our CUDA implementation.
We present a technique for visualizing complicated mathematical surfaces that is inspired by hand-designed topological illustrations. Our approach generates exploded views that expose the internal structure of such a surface by partitioning it into parallel slices, which are separated from each other along a single linear explosion axis. Our contributions include a set of simple, prescriptive design rules for choosing an explosion axis and placing cutting planes, as well as automatic algorithms for applying these rules. First we analyze the input shape to select the explosion axis based on the detected rotational and reflective symmetries of the input model. We then partition the shape into slices that are designed to help viewers better understand how the shape of the surface and its cross-sections vary along the explosion axis. Our algorithms work directly on triangle meshes, and do not depend on any specific parameterization of the surface. We generate exploded views for a variety of mathematical surfaces using our system.
We present a GPU-based ray-tracing system for the accurate and interactive visualization of cut-surfaces through 3D simulations of physical processes created from spectral/hp high-order finite element methods. When used by the numerical analyst to debug the solver, the ability for the imagery to precisely reflect the data is critical. In practice, the investigator interactively selects from a palette of visualization tools to construct a scene that can answer a query of the data. This is effective as long as the implicit contract of image quality between the individual and the visualization system is upheld. OpenGL rendering of scientific visualizations has worked remarkably well for exploratory visualization for most solver results. This is due to the consistency between the use of first-order representations in the simulation and the linear assumptions inherent in OpenGL (planar fragments and color-space interpolation). Unfortunately, the contract is broken when the solver discretization is of higher-order. There have been attempts to mitigate this through the use of spatial adaptation and/or texture mapping. These methods do a better job of approximating what the imagery should be but are not exact and tend to be view-dependent. This paper introduces new rendering mechanisms that specifically deal with the kinds of native data generated by high-order finite element solvers. The exploratory visualization tools are reassessed and cast in this system with the focus on image accuracy. This is accomplished in a GPU setting to ensure interactivity.
Multi-material components, which contain metal parts surrounded by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.
The generation of smooth surfaces from a mesh of three-dimensional data points is an important problem in geometric modeling. Apart from the pure construction of these curves and surfaces, the analysis of their quality is equally important in the design and manufacturing process. Generalized focal surfaces are presented as a new surface interrogation tool.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper presents an environment for telecollaborative data exploration. It provides the following capabilities essential to data exploration: (1) users can probe the data, defining regions of interest with arbitrary shapes. (2) The selected data can be transformed and displayed in many different ways. (3) Linked cursors can be established between several windows showing data sets with arbitrary relationships. (4) Data can be displayed on any screen across a computer network, allowing for telecollaboration arrangements with linked cursors around the world. (5) Our system is user-extensible, allowing programmers to change any component of it while keeping the remaining functionality. We demonstrate how the system can be used in several applications, such as biomedical imaging, robotics, and wood classification.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Presents a method for constructing tensor product Bezier surfaces from contour (cross-section) data. Minimal area triangulations are used to guide the surface construction, and the final surface reflects the optimality of the triangulation. The resulting surface differs from the initial triangulation in two important ways: it is smooth (as opposed to the piecewise planar triangulation), and it is in tensor product form (as opposed to the irregular triangular mesh). The surface reconstruction is efficient because we do not require an exact minimal surface. The triangulations are used as strong hints, but no more than that. The method requires the computation of both open and closed isoparametric curves of the surface, using triangulations as a guide. These isoparametric curves form a tensor product Bezier surface. We show how to control sampling density by filling and pruning isoparametric curves, for accuracy and economy. A rectangular grid of points is produced that is compatible with the expected format for a tensor product surface interpolation, so that a host of well-supported methods are available to generate and manipulate the surface.
Real time rendering of iso contour surfaces is problematic for large complex data sets. An algorithm is presented that allows very rapid representation of an interval set surrounding an iso contour surface. The algorithm draws upon three main ideas. A fast indexing scheme is used to select only those data points near the contour surface. Hardware assisted splatting is then employed on these data points to produce a volume rendering of the interval set. Finally, by shifting a small window through the indexing scheme or data space, animated volumes are produced showing the changing contour values. In addition to allowing fast selection and rendering of the data, the indexing scheme allows a much compressed representation of the data by eliminating "noise" data points.
A new tool for real time visualization of acoustic sound fields has been developed for a new sound spatialization theatre. The theatre is described and several applications of the acoustic and volumetric modeling software are presented. The visualization system described is a valuable tool for spatial sound researchers, sound engineers and composers using CNMAT's sound spatialization theatre. Further work is in progress on the adaptation of better acoustic simulation methods (M. Monks et al., 1996) for more accurate display of the quality of the reverberant field. The room database will be automatically extracted from a model built with 3D modeling software. Volume visualization strategies are being explored to display sounds in spectral and impulse response form.
Shape modeling is an integral part of many visualization problems. Recent advances in scanning technology and a number of surface reconstruction algorithms have opened up a new paradigm for modeling shapes from samples. Many of the problems currently faced in this modeling paradigm can be traced back to two anomalies in sampling, namely undersampling and oversampling. Boundaries, non-smoothness and small features create undersampling problems, whereas oversampling leads to too many triangles. We use Voronoi cell geometry as a unified guide to detect undersampling and oversampling. We apply these detections in surface reconstruction and model simplification. Guarantees of the algorithms can be proved. The authors show the success of the algorithms empirically on a number of interesting data sets.
In this paper we are presenting a novel approach for rendering large datasets in a view-dependent manner. In a typical view-dependent rendering framework, an appropriate level of detail is selected and sent to the graphics hardware for rendering at each frame. In our approach, we have successfully managed to speed up the selection of the level of detail as well as the rendering of the selected levels. We have accelerated the selection of the appropriate level of detail by not scanning active nodes that do not contribute to the incremental update of the selected level of detail. Our idea is based on imposing a spatial subdivision over the view-dependence trees data-structure, which allows spatial tree cells to refine and merge in real-time rendering to comply with the changes in the active nodes list. The rendering of the selected level of detail is accelerated by using vertex arrays. To overcome the dynamic changes in the selected levels of detail we use multiple small vertex arrays whose sizes depend on the memory on the graphics hardware. These multiple vertex arrays are attached to the active cells of the spatial tree and represent the active nodes of these cells. These vertex arrays, which are sent to the graphics hardware at each frame, merge and split with respect to the changes in the cells of the spatial tree.
We report on using computed tomography (CT) as a model acquisition tool for complex objects in computer graphics. Unlike other modeling and scanning techniques the complexity of the object is irrelevant in CT, which naturally enables to model objects with, for example, concavities, holes, twists or fine surface details. Once the data is scanned, one can apply post-processing techniques for data enhancement, modification or presentation. For demonstration purposes we chose to scan a Christmas tree which exhibits high complexity which is difficult or even impossible to handle with other techniques. However, care has to be taken to achieve good scanning results with CT. Further, we illustrate post-processing by means of data segmentation and photorealistic as well as non-photorealistic surface and volume rendering techniques.
We develop a new approach to reconstruct non-discrete models from gridded volume samples. As a model, we use quadratic trivariate super splines on a uniform tetrahedral partition /spl Delta/. The approximating splines are determined in a natural and completely symmetric way by averaging local data samples, such that appropriate smoothness conditions are automatically satisfied. On each tetra-hedron of /spl Delta/ , the quasi-interpolating spline is a polynomial of total degree two which provides several advantages including efficient computation, evaluation and visualization of the model. We apply Bernstein-Bezier techniques well-known in CAGD to compute and evaluate the trivariate spline and its gradient. With this approach the volume data can be visualized efficiently e.g., with isosurface ray-casting. Along an arbitrary ray the splines are univariate, piecewise quadratics and thus the exact intersection for a prescribed isovalue can be easily determined in an analytic and exact way. Our results confirm the efficiency of the quasi-interpolating method and demonstrate high visual quality for rendered isosurfaces.
Techniques in numerical simulation such as the finite element method depend on basis functions for approximating the geometry and variation of the solution over discrete regions of a domain. Existing visualization systems can visualize these basis functions if they are linear, or for a small set of simple non-linear bases. However, newer numerical approaches often use basis functions of elevated and mixed order or complex form; hence existing visualization systems cannot directly process them. In this paper we describe an approach that supports automatic, adaptive tessellation of general basis functions using a flexible and extensible software architecture in conjunction with an on demand, edge-based recursive subdivision algorithm. The framework supports the use of functions implemented in external simulation packages, eliminating the need to reimplement the bases within the visualization system. We demonstrate our method on several examples, and have implemented the framework in the open-source visualization system VTK.
The study of physical models for knots has recently received much interest in the mathematics community. In this paper, we consider the ropelength model, which considers knots tied in an idealized rope. This model is interesting in pure mathematics, and has been applied to the study of a variety of problems in the natural sciences as well. Modeling and visualizing the tightening of knots in this idealized rope poses some interesting challenges in computer graphics. In particular, self-contact in a deformable rope model is a difficult problem which cannot be handled by standard techniques. In this paper, we describe a solution based on reformulating the contact problem and using constrained-gradient techniques from nonlinear optimization. The resulting animations reveal new properties of the tightening flow and provide new insights into the geometric structure of tight knots and links.
Meteorological research involves the analysis of multi-field, multi-scale, and multi-source data sets. Unfortunately, traditional atmospheric visualization systems only provide tools to view a limited number of variables and small segments of the data. These tools are often restricted to 2D contour or vector plots or 3D isosurfaces. The meteorologist must mentally synthesize the data from multiple plots to glean the information needed to produce a coherent picture of the weather phenomenon of interest. In order to provide better tools to meteorologists and reduce system limitations, we have designed an integrated atmospheric visual analysis and exploration system for interactive analysis of weather data sets. Our system allows for the integrated visualization of 1D, 2D, and 3D atmospheric data sets in common meteorological grid structures and utilizes a variety of rendering techniques. These tools provide meteorologists with new abilities to analyze their data and answer questions on regions of interest, ranging from physics-based atmospheric rendering to illustrative rendering containing particles and glyphs. In this paper, we discuss the use and performance of our visual analysis for two important meteorological applications. The first application is warm rain formation in small cumulus clouds. In this, our three-dimensional, interactive visualization of modeled drop trajectories within spatially correlated fields from a cloud simulation has provided researchers with new insight. Our second application is improving and validating severe storm models, specifically the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. This is done through correlative visualization of WRF model and experimental Doppler storm data
We present a general framework for the modeling and optimization of scalable multi-projector displays. Based on this framework, we derive algorithms that can robustly optimize the visual quality of an arbitrary combination of projectors without manual adjustment. When the projectors are tiled, we show that our framework automatically produces blending maps that outperform state-of-the-art projector blending methods. When all the projectors are superimposed, the framework can produce high-resolution images beyond the Nyquist resolution limits of component projectors. When a combination of tiled and superimposed projectors are deployed, the same framework harnesses the best features of both tiled and superimposed multi-projector projection paradigms. The framework creates for the first time a new unified paradigm that is agnostic to a particular configuration of projectors yet robustly optimizes for the brightness, contrast, and resolution of that configuration. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms support high resolution video at real-time interactive frame rates achieved on commodity graphics platforms. This work allows for inexpensive, compelling, flexible, and robust large scale visualization systems to be built and deployed very efficiently.
Particle deposition in the small bronchial tubes (generations six through twelve) is strongly influenced by the vortex-dominated secondary flows that are induced by axial curvature of the tubes. In this paper, we employ particle destination maps in conjunction with two-dimensional, finite-time Lyapunov exponent maps to illustrate how the trajectories of finite-mass particles are influenced by the presence of vortices. We consider two three-generation bronchial tube models: a planar, asymmetric geometry and a non-planar, asymmetric geometry. Our visualizations demonstrate that these techniques, coupled with judiciously seeded particle trajectories, are effective tools for studying particle/flow structure interactions.
In this paper we present a novel anisotropic diffusion model targeted for 3D scalar field data. Our model preserves material boundaries as well as fine tubular structures while noise is smoothed out. One of the major novelties is the use of the directional second derivative to define material boundaries instead of the gradient magnitude for thresholding. This results in a diffusion model that has much lower sensitivity to the diffusion parameter and smoothes material boundaries consistently compared to gradient magnitude based techniques. We empirically analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed diffusion and demonstrate its de-noising capabilities for both analytic and real data. We also discuss applications in the context of volume rendering.
In many applications of Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) the importance of a certain material or feature is highly dependent on its relative spatial location. For instance, in the medical diagnostic procedure, the patient's symptoms often lead to specification of features, tissues and organs of particular interest. One such example is pockets of gas which, if found inside the body at abnormal locations, are a crucial part of a diagnostic visualization. This paper presents an approach that enhances DVR transfer function design with spatial localization based on user specified material dependencies. Semantic expressions are used to define conditions based on relations between different materials, such as only render iodine uptake when close to liver. The underlying methods rely on estimations of material distributions which are acquired by weighing local neighborhoods of the data against approximations of material likelihood functions. This information is encoded and used to influence rendering according to the user's specifications. The result is improved focus on important features by allowing the user to suppress spatially less-important data. In line with requirements from actual clinical DVR practice, the methods do not require explicit material segmentation that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to achieve in most real cases. The scheme scales well to higher dimensions which accounts for multi-dimensional transfer functions and multivariate data. Dual-Energy Computed Tomography, an important new modality in radiology, is used to demonstrate this scalability. In several examples we show significantly improved focus on clinically important aspects in the rendered images.
An instant and quantitative assessment of spatial distances between two objects plays an important role in interactive applications such as virtual model assembly, medical operation planning, or computational steering. While some research has been done on the development of distance-based measures between two objects, only very few attempts have been reported to visualize such measures in interactive scenarios. In this paper we present two different approaches for this purpose, and we investigate the effectiveness of these approaches for intuitive 3D implant positioning in a medical operation planning system. The first approach uses cylindrical glyphs to depict distances, which smoothly adapt their shape and color to changing distances when the objects are moved. This approach computes distances directly on the polygonal object representations by means of ray/triangle mesh intersection. The second approach introduces a set of slices as additional geometric structures, and uses color coding on surfaces to indicate distances. This approach obtains distances from a precomputed distance field of each object. The major findings of the performed user study indicate that a visualization that can facilitate an instant and quantitative analysis of distances between two objects in interactive 3D scenarios is demanding, yet can be achieved by including additional monocular cues into the visualization.
The authors propose a methodology that will extract a topologically closed geometric model from a two-dimensional image. This is accomplished by starting with a simple model that is already topologically closed and deforming the model, based on a set of constraints, so that the model grows (shrinks) to fit the feature within the image while maintaining its closed and locally simple nature. The initial model is a non-self-intersecting polygon that is either embedded in the feature or surrounds the feature. There is a cost function associated with every vertex that quantifies its deformation, the properties of simple polygons, and the relationship between noise and feature. The constraints embody local properties of simple polygons and the nature of the relationship between noise and the features in the image.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We propose to fit triangular NURBS surfaces to noisy, sparse, scattered 3D data while simultaneously localizing and preserving sharp edges. We use a vector voting method to interpolate, from sparse data, three dense potential fields for surfaces, edges, and junctions. The global voting interpolants encode several human perceptual grouping principles such as cosurfacity, proximity, and constancy of curvature. The inferred potential fields are stored in three volumetric grids, giving each voxel the probability of being a surface point, an edge point, and a junction point. Then we use a new model called "winged B snakes", which are deformable triangular NURBS surfaces embedded with active curves, to fit the surfaces and align the edges and junctions. Finally, a smooth C/sup 1/ surface which preserves discontinuity edges and junctions is constructed. Fine tuning and surface fairing is done by adjusting the weights.
Recursive subdivision schemes have been extensively used in computer graphics and scientific visualization for modeling smooth surfaces of arbitrary topology. Recursive subdivision generates a visually pleasing smooth surface in the limit from an initial user-specified polygonal mesh through the repeated application of a fixed set of subdivision rules. In this paper, we present a new dynamic surface model based on the Catmull-Clark (1978) subdivision scheme, which is a very popular method to model complicated objects of arbitrary genus because of many of its nice properties. Our new dynamic surface model inherits the attractive properties of the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme as well as that of the physics-based modeling paradigm. This new model provides a direct and intuitive means of manipulating geometric shapes, a fast, robust and hierarchical approach for recovering complex geometric shapes from range and volume data using very few degrees of freedom (control vertices). We provide an analytic formulation and introduce the physical quantities required to develop the dynamic subdivision surface model which can be interactively deformed by applying synthesized forces in real time. The governing dynamic differential equation is derived using Lagrangian mechanics and a finite element discretization. Our experiments demonstrate that this new dynamic model has a promising future in computer graphics, geometric shape design and scientific visualization.
Presents a system for interactively visualizing large polygonal environments such as those produced by CAD systems during the design of aircraft and power generation engines. Our method combines view frustum culling with level-of-detail modeling to create a visualization system that supports part motion and has the ability to view arbitrary sets of data. To avoid long system start-up delays due to data loading, we have implemented our system using a dynamic loading strategy. This also allows us to interactively visualize more data than could fit in memory at one time.
One of the main research topics in scientific visualization is to "visualize the appropriate features" of a certain structure or data set. Geodesics are very important in geometry and physics, but there is one major problem which prevents scientists from using them as a visualization tool: the differential equations for geodesics are very complicated and in most cases numerical algorithms must be used. There is always a certain approximation error involved. How can you be sure to visualize the features and not only the approximation quality. The paper presents an algorithm to overcome this problem. It consists of two parts. In the first, a geometric method for the construction of geodesics of arbitrary surfaces is introduced. This method is based on the fundamental property that geodesics are a generalization of straight lines on plains. In the second part these geodesics are used to generate local nets on the surfaces.
We present several techniques for user-centric viewing of the virtual objects or datasets under haptic exploration and manipulation. Depending on the type of tasks performed by the user, our algorithms compute automatic placement of the user viewpoint to navigate through the scene, to display the near-optimal views, and to reposition the viewpoint for haptic visualization. This is accomplished by conjecturing the user's intent based on the user's actions, the object geometry, and intra- and inter-object occlusion relationships. These algorithms have been implemented and interfaced with both a 3-DOF and a 6-DOF PHANToM arms. We demonstrate their application on haptic exploration and visualization of a complex structure, as well as multiresolution modeling and 3D painting with a haptic interface.
Unstructured meshes are often used in simulations and imaging applications. They provide advanced flexibility in modeling abilities but are more difficult to manipulate and analyze than regular data. This work provides a novel approach for the analysis of unstructured meshes using feature-space clustering and feature-detection. Analyzing and revealing underlying structures in data involve operators on both spatial and functional domains. Slicing concentrates more on the spatial domain, while iso-surfacing or volume rendering concentrate more on the functional domain. Nevertheless, many times it is the combination of the two domains which provides real insight on the structure of the data. In this work, a combined feature-space is defined on top of unstructured meshes in order to search for structure in the data. A point in feature-space includes the spatial coordinates of the point in the mesh domain and all chosen attributes defined on the mesh. A distance measures between points in feature-space is defined enabling the utilization of clustering using the mean shift procedure (previously used for images) on unstructured meshes. Feature space analysis is shown to be useful for feature-extraction, for data exploration and partitioning.
In this paper we propose a new method for the creation of normal maps for recovering the detail on simplified meshes and a set of objective techniques to metrically evaluate the quality of different recovering techniques. The proposed techniques, that automatically produces a normal-map texture for a simple 3D model that "imitates" the high frequency detail originally present in a second, much higher resolution one, is based on the computation of per-texel visibility and self-occlusion information. This information is used to define a point-to-point correspondence between simplified and hires meshes. Moreover, we introduce a number of criteria for measuring the quality (visual or otherwise) of a given mapping method, and provide efficient algorithms to implement them. Lastly, we apply them to rate different mapping methods, including the widely used ones and the new one proposed here.
ImageSurfer is a tool designed to explore correlations between two 3D scalar fields. Our scientific goal was to determine where a protein is located, and how much its concentration varies along the membrane of a neuronal dendrite. The 3D scalar field data sets fall into two categories: dendritic plasma membranes (defining the structure) and immunofluorescent staining (defining protein concentration along the structure). ImageSurfer enables scientists to analyze relationships between multiple data sets obtained with confocal microscopy by providing 3D surface view, height field, and graphing tools. Each tool reduces the complexity of the problem by extracting a restricted subset of data: finding a region of interest in 3D; getting a sense of relative concentrations in 2D, and getting exact concentration values in 1D. The current design is presented, along with the rationale for each design decision. The tool is already proving useful for data exploration, analysis, and presentation.
The study of stress and strains in soils and structures (solids) help us gain a better understanding of events such as failure of bridges, dams and buildings, or accumulated stresses and strains in geological subduction zones that could trigger earthquakes and subsequently tsunamis. In such domains, the key feature of interest is the location and orientation of maximal shearing planes. This paper describes a method that highlights this feature in stress tensor fields. It uses a plane-in-a-box glyph which provides a global perspective of shearing planes based on local analysis of tensors. The analysis can be performed over the entire domain, or the user can interactively specify where to introduce these glyphs. Alternatively, they can also be placed depending on the threshold level of several physical relevant parameters such as double couple and compensated linear vector dipole. Both methods are tested on stress tensor fields from geomechanics.
This paper describes the adaptation and evaluation of existing nested-surface visualization techniques for the problem of displaying intersecting surfaces. For this work, we collaborated with a neurosurgeon who is comparing multiple tumor segmentations with the goal of increasing the segmentation accuracy and reliability. A second collaborator, a physicist, aims to validate geometric models of specimens against atomic-force microscope images of actual specimens. These collaborators are interested in comparing both surface shape and inter-surface distances. Many commonly employed techniques for visually comparing multiple surfaces (side-by-side, wireframe, colormaps, uniform translucence) do not simultaneously convey inter-surface distance and the shapes of two or more surfaces. This paper describes a simple geometric partitioning of intersecting surfaces that enables the application of existing nested-surface techniques, such as texture-modulated translucent rendering of exteriors, to a broader range of visualization problems. Three user studies investigate the performance of existing techniques and a new shadow-casting glyph technique. The results of the first user study show that texture glyphs on partitioned, intersecting surfaces can convey inter-surface distance better than directly mapping distance to a red-gray-blue color scale on a single surface. The results of the second study show similar results for conveying local surface orientation. The results of the third user study show that adding cast shadows to texture glyphs can increase the understanding of inter-surface distance in static images, but can be overpowered by the shape cues from a simple rocking motion.
We investigate the use of a Fourier-domain derivative error kernel to quantify the error incurred while estimating the gradient of a function from scalar point samples on a regular lattice. We use the error kernel to show that gradient reconstruction quality is significantly enhanced merely by shifting the reconstruction kernel to the centers of the principal lattice directions. Additionally, we exploit the algebraic similarities between the scalar and derivative error kernels to design asymptotically optimal gradient estimation filters that can be factored into an infinite impulse response interpolation prefilter and a finite impulse response directional derivative filter. This leads to a significant performance gain both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The interpolation prefilter provides an accurate scalar approximation and can be re-used to cheaply compute directional derivatives on-the-fly without the need to store gradients. We demonstrate the impact of our filters in the context of volume rendering of scalar data sampled on the Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices. Our results rival those obtained from other competitive gradient estimation methods while incurring no additional computational or storage overhead.
The authors describe the architecture of an end-user visualization system that supports interactive analysis of three-dimensional scalar and vector data in a heterogeneous hardware environment. The system supports a variety of visualization methods with applicability in disciplines such as computational fluid dynamics, earth, and space sciences, and finite-element analysis. The authors discuss how design goals and hardware constraints lead to a simple, cohesive paradigm for implementing a powerful, flexible, and portable visualization system. To assure efficient operation across a broad range of hardware platforms, the tools were implemented so that their interactivity is largely independent of data complexity. To gain portability, the system was built on a platform-independent graphics layer and user interface management system. The authors outline general concerns with current visualization methods and show how the approach simplifies the visualization process.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Effective methods for visualizing several sets of volumetric data simultaneously are presented. The methods involve the composition of multiple volumetric rendering techniques. These techniques include contour curves, color-blended contour regions, projection graphs on surfaces, isovalue surface construction, and hypersurface projection graphs.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
MRIVIEW is a software system that uses image processing and visualization to provide neuroscience researchers with an integrated environment for combining functional and anatomical information. Key features of the software include semi-automated segmentation of volumetric head data and an interactive coordinate reconciliation method which utilizes surface visualization. The current system is a precursor to a computational brain atlas. We describe features this atlas will incorporate, including methods under development for visualizing brain functional data obtained from several different research modalities.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We show how to create 3D models of maternal pelvis and fetal head from magnetic resonance images (MRI). The models are used to simulate the progress of delivery in order to give a prognosis of successful labor.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Software has been developed to apply visualization techniques to aeronautics data collected during wind tunnel experiments. Interaction between the software developers and the aeroscientists has been crucial in making the software. The interaction has also been important in building the scientists' confidence in the use of interactive, computer-mediated analysis tools.
In our study of regional climate modeling and simulation, we frequently encounter vector fields that are crowded with large numbers of critical points. A critical point in a flow is where the vector field vanishes. While these critical points accurately reflect the topology of the vector fields, in our study only a subset of them is worth further investigation. We present a filtering technique based on the vorticity of the vector fields to eliminate the less interesting and sometimes sporadic critical points in a multiresolution fashion. The neighboring regions of the preserved features, which are characterized by strong shear and circulation, are potential locations of weather instability. We apply our feature filtering technique to a regional climate modeling data set covering East Asia in the summer of 1991.
We demonstrate the use of a combination of perceptually effective techniques for visualizing magnetic field data from the DIII-D Tokamak. These techniques can be implemented to run very efficiently on machines with hardware support for OpenGL. Interactive speeds facilitate clear communication of magnetic field structure, enhancing fusion scientists' understanding of their data, and thereby accelerating their research.
The paper describes a novel application of feature preserving mesh simplification to the problem of managing large, multidimensional datasets during scientific visualization. To allow this, we view a scientific dataset as a triangulated mesh of data elements, where the attributes embedded in each element form a set of properties arrayed across the surface of the mesh. Existing simplification techniques were not designed to address the high dimensionality that exists in these types of datasets. In addition, vertex operations that relocate, insert, or remove data elements may need to be modified or restricted. Principal component analysis provides an algorithm-independent method for compressing a dataset's dimensionality during simplification. Vertex locking forces certain data elements to maintain their spatial locations; this technique is also used to guarantee a minimum density in the simplified dataset. The result is a visualization that significantly reduces the number of data elements to display, while at the same time ensuring that high-variance regions of potential interest remain intact. We apply our techniques to a number of well-known feature preserving algorithms, and demonstrate their applicability in a real-world context by simplifying a multidimensional weather dataset. Our results show a significant improvement in execution time with only a small reduction in accuracy; even when the dataset was simplified to 10% of its original size, average per attribute error was less than 1%.
Commonly-used subdivision schemes require manifold control meshes and produce manifold surfaces. However, it is often necessary to model nonmanifold surfaces, such as several surface patches meeting at a common boundary. In this paper, we describe a subdivision algorithm that makes it possible to model nonmanifold surfaces. Any triangle mesh, subject only to the restriction that no two vertices of any triangle coincide, can serve as an input to the algorithm. Resulting surfaces consist of collections of manifold patches joined along nonmanifold curves and vertices. If desired, constraints may be imposed on the tangent planes of manifold patches sharing a curve or a vertex. The algorithm is an extension of a well-known Loop subdivision scheme, and uses techniques developed for piecewise smooth surfaces.
Traditional methods for displaying weather products are generally two-dimensional (2D) plots or just text format. It is hard for forecasters to get the entire picture of the atmosphere using these methods. The problems apparent in 2D with comparing and correlating multiple layers are overcome simply by adding a dimension. This is important because pertinent features in the data sets may lie in multiple layers and span several time steps. However, simply using a three-dimensional (3D) approach is not enough. The capacity for analysis of small-scale, but important, features in 2D are lost when transitioning to 3D. We propose that 3D's advantages can be incorporated with 2D's small-scale analysis by using an immersive virtual environment. In this case study, we evaluate our current standing with the project: have we met our goals, and how should we proceed from this point? To evaluate our application, we invited meteorologists to use the application to explore a data set. Then we presented our goals and asked which ones had we met, from a meteorologist's perspective. The results qualitatively reflected that our application was effective and further research would be worthwhile.
This paper describes an efficient algorithm to model the light attenuation due to a participating media with low albedo. The light attenuation is modeled using splatting volume renderer for both the viewer and the light source. During the rendering, a 2D shadow buffer attenuates the light for each pixel. When the contribution of a footprint is added to the image buffer, as seen from the eye, we add the contribution to the shadow buffer, as seen from the light source. We have generated shadows for point lights and parallel lights using this algorithm. The shadow algorithm has been extended to deal with multiple light sources and projective textured lights.
We present a method to represent unstructured scalar fields at multiple levels of detail. Using a parallelizable classification algorithm to build a cluster hierarchy, we generate a multiresolution representation of a given volumetric scalar data set. The method uses principal component analysis (PCA) for cluster generation and a fitting technique based on radial basis functions (RBFs). Once the cluster hierarchy has been generated, we utilize a variety of techniques for extracting different levels of detail. The main strength of this work is its generality. Regardless of grid type, this method can be applied to any discrete scalar field representation, even one given as a "point cloud".
We present a higher-order approach to the extraction of isosurfaces from unstructured meshes. Existing methods use linear interpolation along each mesh edge to find isosurface intersections. In contrast, our method determines intersections by performing barycentric interpolation over diamonds formed by the tetrahedra incident to each edge. Our method produces smoother, more accurate isosurfaces. Additionally, interpolating over diamonds, rather than linearly interpolating edge endpoints. enables us to identify up to two isosurface intersections per edge. This paper details how our new technique extracts isopoints, and presents a simple connection strategy for forming a triangle mesh isosurface.
In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections. Large and heterogeneous data collections are difficult to analyze and pose specific problems to interactive visualization. Application of the traditional interactive processing and visualization approaches as well as batch processing encounter considerable drawbacks for such large and heterogeneous data collections due to the amount and type of data. Computing resources are not sufficient for interactive exploration of the data and automated analysis has the disadvantage that the user has only limited control and feedback on the analysis process. In our approach, an analysis procedure with features and attributes of interest for the analysis is defined interactively. This procedure is used for offline processing of large collections of data sets. The results of the batch process along with "visual summaries" are used for further analysis. Visualization is not only used for the presentation of the result, but also as a tool to monitor the validity and quality of the operations performed during the batch process. Operations such as feature extraction and attribute calculation of the collected data sets are validated by visual inspection. This approach is illustrated by an extensive case study, in which a collection of confocal microscopy data sets is analyzed
In Toponomics, the function protein pattern in cells or tissue (the toponome) is imaged and analyzed for applications in toxicology, new drug development and patient-drug-interaction. The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.
This paper presents an object-oriented system design supporting the composition of scientific data visualization techniques based on the definition of hierarchies of typed data objects and tools. Traditional visualization systems focus on creating graphical objects which often cannot be re-used for further processing. Our approach provides objects of different topological dimension to offer a natural way of describing the results of visualization mappings. Serial composition of data extraction tools is allowed, while each intermediate visualization object shares a common description and behavior. Visualization objects can be re-used, facilitating the data exploration process by expanding the available analysis and correlation functions provided. This design offers an open-ended architecture for the development of new visualization techniques. It promotes data and software re-use, eliminates the need for writing special purpose software and reduces processing requirements during interactive visualization sessions.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Annotation is a key activity of data analysis. However, current data analysis systems focus almost exclusively on visualization. We propose a system which integrates annotations into a visualization system. Annotations are embedded in 3D data space, using the Post-it metaphor. This embedding allows contextual-based information storage and retrieval, and facilitates information sharing in collaborative environments. We provide a traditional database filter and a Magic Lens filter to create specialized views of the data. The system is customized for fluid flow applications, with features which allow users to store parameters of visualization tools and sketch 3D volumes.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Diagrams are data representations that convey information predominantly through combinations of graphical elements rather than through other channels such as text or interaction. We have implemented a prototype called AVE (Automatic Visualization Environment) that generates diagrams automatically based on a generative theory of diagram design. According to this theory, diagrams are constructed based on the data to be visualized rather than by selection from a predefined set of diagrams. This approach can be applied to knowledge represented by semantic networks. We give a brief introduction to the underlying theory, then describe the implementation and finally discuss strategies for extending the algorithm.
It is well known that the spatial frequency spectra of membrane and thin-plate splines exhibit self-affine characteristics and hence behave as fractals. This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopoulos (1989), which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques, namely a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which, unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously. In addition, we demonstrate the capability to generate arbitrary-order fractal surfaces without resorting to blending techniques. Using this fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, we demonstrate the synthesis of realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.
One common problem in the practical application of volume visualization is the proper choice of transfer functions in order to color different parts of the volume meaningfully. This interactive process can be very complicated and time consuming. An alternative to the adjustment of transfer functions is the application of segmentation algorithms. These algorithms are often dedicated to a limited range of data sets and tend to be very compute intensive. We propose a morphology based hierarchical analysis to estimate the optical properties of the volume to be rendered. This approach requires fewer parameters and incorporates also spatial information, but it is far less compute intensive than most of the segmentation methods. The hierarchical analysis is constructed in analogy to the wavelet analysis, except for the fact, that nonlinear filters are used in our case. These morphological operators have a lower distortional influence on the analyzed structures than the usual linear filters. A special decomposition of the morphological operators is discussed, which leads to an efficient implementation of this approach. This technique reduces the three dimensional analysis to a one dimensional computation, as it is done in tensor product based linear filters. The resulting decomposition may also be parallelized easily. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique by applying it to medical and technical data sets.
The paper details the use of a Virtual Environment for Reconstructive Surgery (VERS) in the case of a 17 year-old boy with a severe facial defect, arising from the removal of a soft tissue tumor. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken of the patient, the data were segmented, a mesh was generated, and this patient-specific mesh was used in a virtual environment by the surgeons for preoperative visualization of the defect, planning of the surgery, and production of a custom surgical template to aid in repairing the defect. The paper details the case of this patient, provides a background on the virtual environment technology used, discusses the difficulties encountered, and describes the lessons learned.
Many applications produce three-dimensional points that must be further processed to generate a surface. Surface reconstruction algorithms that start with a set of unorganized points are extremely time-consuming. Sometimes however, points are generated such that there is additional information available to the reconstruction algorithm. We present Spiraling Edge, a specialized algorithm for surface reconstruction that is three orders of magnitude faster than algorithms for the general case. In addition to sample point locations, our algorithm starts with normal information and knowledge of each point's neighbors. Our algorithm produces a localized approximation to the surface by creating a star-shaped triangulation between a point and a subset of its nearest neighbors. This surface patch is extended by locally triangulating each of the points along the edge of the patch. As each edge point is triangulated, it is removed from the edge and new edge points along the patch's edge are inserted in its place. The updated edge spirals out over the surface until the edge encounters a surface boundary and stops growing in that direction, or until the edge reduces to a small hole that is filled by the final triangle.
Much of the research in scientific visualization has focused on complete sets of gridded data. The paper presents our experience dealing with gridded data sets with a large number of missing or invalid data, and some of our experiments in addressing the shortcomings of standard off-the-shelf visualization algorithms. In particular, we discuss the options in modifying known algorithms to adjust to the specifics of sparse datasets, and provide a new technique to smooth out the side-effects of the operations. We apply our findings to data acquired from NEXRAD (NEXt generation RADars) weather radars, which usually have no more than 3 to 4 percent of all possible cell points filled.
This work describes a method to visualize the thickness of curved thin objects. Given the MRI volume data of articular cartilage, medical doctors investigate pathological changes of the thickness. Since the tissue is very thin, it is impossible to reliably map the thickness information by direct volume rendering. Our idea is based on unfolding of such structures preserving their thickness. This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.
Coloring higher order scientific data is problematic using standard linear methods as found in OpenGL. The visual results are inaccurate when there is a large scalar gradient over an element or when the scalar field is nonlinear. In addition to shading nonlinear data, last and accurate rendering of planar cuts through parametric elements can be implemented using programmable shaders on current graphics hardware. The intersection of a planar cut with geometrically curved volume elements can be rendered using a combination of selective refinement and programmable shaders. This hybrid algorithm also handles curved 2D planar triangles.
Analysis of phenomena that simultaneously occur on different spatial and temporal scales requires adaptive, hierarchical schemes to reduce computational and storage demands. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes support both refinement in space that results in a time-dependent grid topology, as well as refinement in time that results in updates at higher rates for refined levels. Visualization of AMR data requires generating data for absent refinement levels at specific time steps. We describe a solution starting from a given set of "key frames" with potentially different grid topologies. The presented work was developed in a project involving several research institutes that collaborate in the field of cosmology and numerical relativity. AMR data results from simulations that are run on dedicated compute machines and is thus stored centrally, whereas the analysis of the data is performed on the local computers of the scientists. We built a distributed solution using remote procedure calls (RPC). To keep the application responsive, we split the bulk data transfer from the RPC response and deliver it asynchronously as a binary stream. The number of network round-trips is minimized by using high level operations. In summary, we provide an application for exploratory visualization of remotely stored AMR data.
We present visualization tools for analyzing molecular simulations of liquid crystal (LC) behavior. The simulation data consists of terabytes of data describing the position and orientation of every molecule in the simulated system over time. Condensed matter physicists study the evolution of topological defects in these data, and our visualization tools focus on that goal. We first convert the discrete simulation data to a sampled version of a continuous second-order tensor field and then use combinations of visualization methods to simultaneously display combinations of contractions of the tensor data, providing an interactive environment for exploring these complicated data. The system, built using AVS, employs colored cutting planes, colored isosurfaces, and colored integral curves to display fields of tensor contractions including Westin's scalar c&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;p &lt;/sub&gt;, and c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; metrics and the principal eigenvector. Our approach has been in active use in the physics lab for over a year. It correctly displays structures already known; it displays the data in a spatially and temporally smoother way than earlier approaches, avoiding confusing grid effects and facilitating the study of multiple time steps; it extends the use of tools developed for visualizing diffusion tensor data, re-interpreting them in the context of molecular simulations; and it has answered long-standing questions regarding the orientation of molecules around defects and the conformational changes of the defects
Large datasets typically contain coarse features comprised of finer sub-features. Even if the shapes of the small structures are evident in a 3D display, the aggregate shapes they suggest may not be easily inferred. From previous studies in shape perception, the evidence has not been clear whether physically-based illumination confers any advantage over local illumination for understanding scenes that arise in visualization of large data sets that contain features at two distinct scales. In this paper we show that physically-based illumination can improve the perception for some static scenes of complex 3D geometry from flow fields. We perform human-subjects experiments to quantify the effect of physically-based illumination on participant performance for two tasks: selecting the closer of two streamtubes from a field of tubes, and identifying the shape of the domain of a flow field over different densities of tubes. We find that physically-based illumination influences participant performance as strongly as perspective projection, suggesting that physically-based illumination is indeed a strong cue to the layout of complex scenes. We also find that increasing the density of tubes for the shape identification task improved participant performance under physically-based illumination but not under the traditional hardware-accelerated illumination model.
This paper describes advanced volume visualization and quantification for applications in non-destructive testing (NDT), which results in novel and highly effective interactive workflows for NDT practitioners. We employ a visual approach to explore and quantify the features of interest, based on transfer functions in the parameter spaces of specific application scenarios. Examples are the orientations of fibres or the roundness of particles. The applicability and effectiveness of our approach is illustrated using two specific scenarios of high practical relevance. First, we discuss the analysis of Steel Fibre Reinforced Sprayed Concrete (SFRSpC). We investigate the orientations of the enclosed steel fibres and their distribution, depending on the concrete's application direction. This is a crucial step in assessing the material's behavior under mechanical stress, which is still in its infancy and therefore a hot topic in the building industry. The second application scenario is the designation of the microstructure of ductile cast irons with respect to the contained graphite. This corresponds to the requirements of the ISO standard 945-1, which deals with 2D metallographic samples. We illustrate how the necessary analysis steps can be carried out much more efficiently using our system for 3D volumes. Overall, we show that a visual approach with custom transfer functions in specific application domains offers significant benefits and has the potential of greatly improving and optimizing the workflows of domain scientists and engineers.
In flow simulations the behavior and properties of particle trajectories often depend on the physical geometry contained in the simulated environment. Understanding the flow in and around the geometry itself is an important part of analyzing the data. Previous work has often utilized focus+context rendering techniques, with an emphasis on showing trajectories while simplifying or illustratively rendering the physical areas. Our research instead emphasizes the local relationship between particle paths and geometry by using a projected multi-field visualization technique. The correlation between a particle path and its surrounding area is calculated on-the-fly and displayed in a non-intrusive manner. In addition, we support visual exploration and comparative analysis through the use of linked information visualization, such as manipulatable curve plots and one-on-one similarity plots. Our technique is demonstrated on particle trajectories from a groundwater simulation and a computer room airflow simulation, where the flow of particles is highly influenced by the dense geometry.
Continuous Parallel Coordinates (CPC) are a contemporary visualization technique in order to combine several scalar fields, given over a common domain. They facilitate a continuous view for parallel coordinates by considering a smooth scalar field instead of a finite number of straight lines. We show that there are feature curves in CPC which appear to be the dominant structures of a CPC. We present methods to extract and classify them and demonstrate their usefulness to enhance the visualization of CPCs. In particular, we show that these feature curves are related to discontinuities in Continuous Scatterplots (CSP). We show this by exploiting a curve-curve duality between parallel and Cartesian coordinates, which is a generalization of the well-known point-line duality. Furthermore, we illustrate the theoretical considerations. Concluding, we discuss relations and aspects of the CPC's/CSP's features concerning the data analysis.
A hierarchical triangulation built from a digital elevation model in grid form is described. The authors present an algorithm that produces a hierarchy of triangulations in which each level of the hierarchy corresponds to a guaranteed level of accuracy. The number of very thin triangles (slivers) is significantly reduced. Such triangles produced undesirable effects in animation. In addition the number of levels of the triangulated irregular network (TIN) tree is reduced. This speeds up searching within the data structure. Tests on data with digital elevation input have confirmed the theoretical expectations. On eight such sets the average sliveriness with the method was between 1/5 and 1/10 of old triangulations and number of levels was about one third. There was an increase in the number of descendants at each level, but the total number of triangles was also lower.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Texture mapping is normally used to convey geometric detail without adding geometric complexity. This paper introduces Boolean textures, a texture mapping technique that uses implicit functions to generate texture maps and texture coordinates. These Boolean textures perform clipping during a renderer's scan conversion step. Any implicit function is a candidate Boolean texture clipper. The paper describes how to use quadrics as clippers. Applications from engineering and medicine illustrate the effectiveness of texture as a clipping tool.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The process of visualizing a scientific data set requires an extensive knowledge of the domain in which the data set is created. Because an in-depth knowledge of all scientific domains is not available to the creator of visualization software, a flexible and extensible visualization system is essential in providing a productive tool to the scientist. This paper presents a shading language, based on the RenderMan shading language, that extends the shading model used to render volume data sets. Data shaders, written in this shading language, give the users of a volume rendering system a means of specifying how a volume data set is to be rendered. This flexibility is useful both as a visualization tool in the scientific community and as a research tool in the visualization community.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present an environment in which users can interactively create different visualization methods. This modular and extensible environment encapsulates most of the existing visualization algorithms. Users can easily construct new visualization methods by combining simple, fine grain building blocks. These components operate on a local subset of the data and generally either look for target features or produce visual objects. Intermediate compositions may also be used to build more complex visualizations. This environment provides a foundation for building and exploring novel visualization methods.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A method for visualizing unknottedness of mathematical knots via energy optimization with simulated annealing is presented. In this method a potential field is formed around a tangled rope that causes it to self-repel. By allowing the rope to evolve in this field in search of an energy minimizing configuration we can determine the knot type of the initial configuration. In particular, it is natural to conjecture that if such a "charged rope" was not initially knotted, it will reach its minimal potential in a circular configuration, given a suitable energy functional. Because situations potentially arise in which the functional may not be strictly unimodal, we suggest it to be advantageous to use a robust stochastic optimization technique (simulated annealing), rather than a deterministic hill climber common in physically based approaches, to make sure that the evolving rope does not settle in a suboptimal configuration. The same method is applicable to simplifying arbitrary knots and links and for establishing knot equivalence. Aside from its theoretical appeal, the method promises to solve practical problems common in genetic research and polymer design.
Comparative visualization has successfully been applied to a variety of fluid dynamic problems. Most applications rely on image level comparison such as experimental flow visualization versus computational flow imagery (CFI) which tries to simulate optical image acquisition in flow testing. When differences become difficult to distinguish or once a quantitative result is required, data level comparison provides powerful means to visualize data from multiple sources. Data level comparison and visualization turns out to be an essential tool in modern aircraft design projects. It is already successfully applied in the geometric preprocessing stage and the CFD analysis and will serve for comparison with experimental data as well.
The detection of vortical phenomena in vector data is one of the key issues in many technical applications, in particular in flow visualization. Many existing approaches rely on purely local evaluation of the vector data. In order to overcome the limits of a local approach, we choose to combine a local method with a correlation of a pre-defined generic vortex with the data in a medium-scale region. Two different concepts of generic vortices were tested on various sets of flow velocity vector data. The approach is not limited to the two generic patterns suggested here. The method was found to successfully detect vortices in cases were other methods fail.
"Free Flight" will change today's air traffic control system by giving pilots increased flexibility to choose and modify their routes in real time, reducing costs and increasing system capacity. This increased flexibility comes at the price of increased complexity. If Free Flight is to become a reality, future air traffic controllers, pilots, and airline managers will require new conflict detection, resolution and visualization decision support tools. The paper describes a testbed system for building and evaluating such tools, including its current capabilities, lessons we learned and feedback received from expert users. The visualization system provides an overall plan view supplemented with a detailed perspective view, allowing a user to examine highlighted conflicts and select from a list of proposed solutions, as the scenario runs in real time. Future steps needed to improve this system are described.
We present a new visibility determination algorithm for interactive virtual endoscopy. The algorithm uses a modified version of template-based ray casting to extract a view dependent set of potentially visible voxels from volume data. The voxels are triangulated by Marching Cubes and the triangles are rendered onto the display by a graphics accelerator. Early ray termination and space leaping are used to accelerate the ray casting step and a quadtree subdivision algorithm is used to reduce the number of cast rays. Compared to other recently proposed rendering algorithms for virtual endoscopy, our rendering algorithm does not require a long preprocessing step or a high-end graphics workstation, but achieves interactive frame rates on a standard PC equipped with a low-cost graphics accelerator.
This paper describes our experience in designing and building a tool for visualizing the results of the CE-QUAL-ICM Three-Dimensional Eutrophication Model, as applied to water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. This model outputs a highly multidimensional dataset over very many timesteps – outstripping the capabilities of the visualization tools available to the research team. As part of the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Programming Environment and Training (PET) project, a special visualization tool was developed. Some problematic issues in efficiently handling and processing the data format from the computational model were resolved through this work. Also, a sophisticated system for dynamically generating visualizations of the data has been implemented. In addition, the development of the VisGen library allows for high-level, flexible control of the VTK graphics pipeline. Coupled with an easy-to-use interface to the application, this allows the user a lot of control over the graphical representation of the data. Once the user has a representation he/she is pleased with, a wide variety of options are provided for how this can be used in presentation, or for sharing with remote colleagues. This paper includes discussions on how the simulation data are handled efficiently, as well as how the issues of usability, flexibility and collaboration are addressed.
We describe a modification of the widely used marching cubes method that leads to the useful property that the resulting isosurfaces are locally single valued functions. This implies that conventional interpolation and approximation methods can be used to locally represent the surface. These representations can be used for computing approximations for local surface properties. We utilize this possibility in order to develop algorithms for locally approximating Gaussian and mean curvature, methods for constrained smoothing of isosurface, and techniques for the parameterization of isosurfaces.

As standard volume rendering is based on an integral in physical space (or "coordinate space"), it is inherently dependent on the scaling of this space. Although this dependency is appropriate for the realistic rendering of semitransparent volumetric objects, it has several unpleasant consequences for volume visualization. In order to overcome these disadvantages, a new variant of the volume rendering integral is proposed, which is defined in data space instead of physical space. Apart from achieving scale invariance, this new method supports the rendering of isosurfaces of uniform opacity and color, independently of the local gradient or" the visualized scalar field. Moreover, it reveals certain structures in scalar fields even with constant transfer functions. Furthermore, it can be defined as the limit of infinitely many semitransparent isosurfaces, and is therefore based on an intuitive and at the same time precise definition. In addition to the discussion of these features of scale-invariant volume rendering, efficient adaptations of existing volume rendering algorithms and extensions for silhouette enhancement and local illumination by transmitted light are presented.
We present the application of hardware accelerated volume rendering algorithms to the simulation of radiographs as an aid to scientists designing experiments, validating simulation codes, and understanding experimental data. The techniques presented take advantage of 32-bit floating point texture capabilities to obtain solutions to the radiative transport equation for X-rays. The hardware accelerated solutions are accurate enough to enable scientists to explore the experimental design space with greater efficiency than the methods currently in use. An unsorted hexahedron projection algorithm is presented for curvilinear hexahedral meshes that produces simulated radiographs in the absorption-only regime. A sorted tetrahedral projection algorithm is presented that simulates radiographs of emissive materials. We apply the tetrahedral projection algorithm to the simulation of experimental diagnostics for inertial confinement fusion experiments on a laser at the University of Rochester.
In this paper we present an algorithm that operates on a triangular mesh and classifies each face of a triangle as either inside or outside. We present three example applications of this core algorithm: normal orientation, inside removal, and layer-based visualization. The distinguishing feature of our algorithm is its robustness even if a difficult input model that includes holes, coplanar triangles, intersecting triangles, and lost connectivity is given. Our algorithm works with the original triangles of the input model and uses sampling to construct a visibility graph that is then segmented using graph cut.
A visualization technique that makes it possible to display and analyze line count profile data is described. The technique is to make a reduced picture of code with the line execution counts identified with color. Hot spots are shown in red, warm spots in orange, and so on. It is possible to identify nonexecuted code and nonexecutable code such as declarations and static tables.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Techniques that manipulate logical time in order to produce coherent animations of parallel program behavior despite the presence of asynchrony are presented. The techniques interpret program behavior in light of user-defined abstractions and generate animations based on a logical, rather than a physical, view of time. If this interpretation succeeds, the resulting animation is easily understood. If it fails, the programmer can be assured that the failure was not an artifact of the visualization. It is shown that these techniques can be generally applied to enhance visualizations of a variety of types of data as they are produced by parallel, MIMD (multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream) computations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A prototype visualization management system is described which merges the capabilities of a database management system with any number of existing visualization packages such as AVS or IDL. The prototype uses the Postgres database management system to store and access Earth science data through a simple graphical browser. Data located in the database is visualized by automatically invoking a desired visualization package and downloading an appropriate script or program. The central idea underlying the system is that information on how to visualize a data set is stored in the database with the data set itself.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We describe the theoretical and practical visualization issues solved in the implementation of an interactive real-time four-dimensional geometry interface for the CAVE, an immersive virtual reality environment. While our specific task is to produce a "virtual geometry" experience by approximating physically correct rendering of manifolds embedded in four dimensions, the general principles exploited by our approach reflect requirements common to many immersive virtual reality applications, especially those involving volume rendering. Among the issues we address are the classification of rendering tasks, the specialized hardware support required to attain interactivity, specific techniques required to render 4D objects, and interactive methods appropriate for our 4D virtual world application.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We consider the problem of approximating a smooth surface f(x, y), based on n scattered samples {(x/sub i/, y/sub i/, z/sub i/)/sub i=1//sup n/} where the sample values {z/sub i/} are contaminated with noise: z/sub i/=f(x/sub i/, y/sub i/)=/spl epsiv//sub i/. We present an algorithm that generates a PLS (piecewise linear surface) f', defined on a triangulation of the sample locations V={(x/sub i/, y/sub i/)/sub i=1//sup n/}, approximating f well. Constructing the PLS involves specifying both the triangulation of V and the values of f' at the points of V. We demonstrate that even when the sampling process is not noisy, a better approximation for f is obtained using our algorithm, compared to existing methods. This algorithm is useful for DTM (digital terrain map) manipulation by polygon-based graphics engines for visualization applications.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors present an image synthesis methodology and a system built around it. Given a sparse set of photographs taken from unknown viewpoints, the system generates images from new, different viewpoints with correct perspective, and handles occlusion. It achieves this without requiring any knowledge about the 3D structure of the scene nor the intrinsic camera parameters. The photo-realistic rendering process is polygon based and can be potentially implemented as real time texture mapping. The system is robust to noise by taking advantage of duplicate information from multiple views. They present results on several example scenes.

The work presents a method to enable matching of level-of-detail (LOD) models to image-plane resolution over large variations in viewing distances often present in exterior images. A relationship is developed between image sampling rate, viewing distance, object projection, and expected image error due to LOD approximations. This is employed in an error metric to compute error profiles for LOD models. Multirate filtering in the frequency space of a reference object image is utilized to approximate multiple distant views over a range of orientations. An importance sampling method is described to better characterize perspective projection over view distance. A contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is employed to approximate the response of the vision system. Examples are presented for multiresolution spheres and a terrain height field feature. Future directions for extending this method are described.
The paper describes a computer modeling and simulation system that supports computational steering, which is an effort to make the typical simulation workflow more efficient. Our system provides an interface that allows scientists to perform all of the steps in the simulation process in parallel and online. It uses a standard network flow visualization package, which has been extended to display graphical output in an immersive virtual environment such as a CAVE. Our system allows scientists to interactively manipulate simulation parameters and observe the results. It also supports inverse steering, where the user specifies the desired simulation result, and the system searches for the simulation parameters that achieve this result. Taken together, these capabilities allow scientists to more efficiently and effectively understand model behavior, as well as to search through simulation parameter space. The paper is also a case study of applying our system to the problem of simulating microwave interactions with missile bodies. Because these interactions are difficult to study experimentally, and have important effects on missile electronics, there is a strong desire to develop and validate simulation models of this phenomena.
The focus of this paper is to evaluate the usefulness of some basic feature tracking algorithms as analysis tools for combustion datasets by application to a dataset modeling autoignition. Features defined as areas of high intermediate concentrations were examined to explore the initial phases in the autoignition process.
We present a multimodal paradigm for exploring topological surfaces embedded in four dimensions; we exploit haptic methods in particular to overcome the intrinsic limitations of 3D graphics images and 3D physical models. The basic problem is that, just as 2D shadows of 3D curves lose structure where lines cross, 3D graphics projections of smooth 4D topological surfaces are interrupted where one surface intersects another. Furthermore, if one attempts to trace real knotted ropes or a plastic models of self-intersecting surfaces with a fingertip, one inevitably collides with parts of the physical artifact. In this work, we exploit the free motion of a computer-based haptic probe to support a continuous motion that follows the local continuity of the object being explored. For our principal test case of 4D-embedded surfaces projected to 3D, this permits us to follow the full local continuity of the surface as though in fact we were touching an actual 4D object. We exploit additional sensory cues to provide supplementary or redundant information. For example, we can use audio tags to note the relative 4D depth of illusory 3D surface intersections produced by projection from 4D, as well as providing automated refinement of the tactile exploration path to eliminate jitter and snagging, resulting in a much cleaner exploratory motion than a bare uncorrected motion. Visual enhancements provide still further improvement to the feedback: by opening a view-direction-defined cutaway into the interior of the 3D surface projection, we allow the viewer to keep the haptic probe continuously in view as it traverses any touchable part of the object. Finally, we extend the static tactile exploration framework using a dynamic mode that links each stylus motion to a change in orientation that creates at each instant a maximal-area screen projection of a neighborhood of the current point of interest. This minimizes 4D distortion and permits true metric sizes to be deduced locally at any point. All these methods combine to reveal the full richness of the complex spatial relationships of the target shapes, and to overcome many expected perceptual limitations in 4D visualization.
Just as we can work with two-dimensional floor plans to communicate 3D architectural design, we can exploit reduced- dimension shadows to manipulate the higher-dimensional objects generating the shadows. In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space. By combining graphics and collision-sensing haptics, we can enhance the 2D shadow-driven editing protocol to successfully leverage 2D pen-and-paper or blackboard skills. Building on the reduced-dimension 2D editing tool for manipulating 3D shapes, we develop the natural analogy to produce a reduced-dimension 3D tool for manipulating 4D shapes. By physically modeling the correct properties of 4D surfaces, their bending forces, and their collisions in the 3D haptic controller interface, we can support full-featured physical exploration of 4D mathematical objects in a manner that is otherwise far beyond the experience accessible to human beings. As far as we are aware, this paper reports the first interactive system with force-feedback that provides "4D haptic visualization" permitting the user to model and interact with 4D cloth-like objects.
We introduce a new method for coloring 3D line fields and show results from its application in visualizing orientation in DTI brain data sets. The method uses Boy's surface, an immersion of RP2 in 3D. This coloring method is smooth and one-to-one except on a set of measure zero, the double curve of Boy's surface.
This paper presents a pipeline for high quality volume rendering of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) datasets. We introduce a new method allowing high quality visualization of hexahedral cells in this context; this method avoids artifacts like discontinuities in the isosurfaces. To achieve this, we choose the number and placement of sampling points over the cast rays according to the analytical properties of the reconstructed signal inside each cell. We extend our method to handle volume shading of such cells. We propose an interpolation scheme that guarantees continuity between adjacent cells of different AMR levels. We introduce an efficient hybrid CPU-GPU mesh traversal technique. We present an implementation of our AMR visualization method on current graphics hardware, and show results demonstrating both the quality and performance of our method.
Shading is an important feature for the comprehension of volume datasets, but is difficult to implement accurately. Current techniques based on pre-integrated direct volume rendering approximate the volume rendering integral by ignoring non-linear gradient variations between front and back samples, which might result in cumulated shading errors when gradient variations are important and / or when the illumination function features high frequencies. In this paper, we explore a simple approach for pre-integrated volume rendering with non-linear gradient interpolation between front and back samples. We consider that the gradient smoothly varies along a quadratic curve instead of a segment in-between consecutive samples. This not only allows us to compute more accurate shaded pre-integrated look-up tables, but also allows us to more efficiently process shading amplifying effects, based on gradient filtering. An interesting property is that the pre-integration tables we use remain two-dimensional as for usual pre-integrated classification. We conduct experiments using a full hardware approach with the Blinn-Phong illumination model as well as with a non-photorealistic illumination model.
An experimental volume visualization system, NetV, that distributes volume imaging tasks to appropriate network resources is described. NetV gives offsite scientists easy access to high-end volume imaging software and hardware. The system allows a user to submit volume imaging jobs to an imaging spooler on a visualization-server. Remote high-power compute engines process rendering tasks, while local workstations run the user-interface. The time required to submit a job, render the job on a mini-supercomputer-class machine, and return the volume imaging to the offsite scientist is far less than the time it would take to create a similar image on a local workstation-class machine.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper describes a highly interactive method for computer visualization of simultaneous three-dimensional vector and scalar flow fields in convection-diffusion systems. This method allows a computational fluid dynamics user to visualize the basic physical process of dispersion and mixing rather than just the vector and scalar values computed by the simulation. It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale. In this way, clouds of fluid elements are traced not just mean paths. We have used this method to visualize the simulation of an industrial incinerator to help identify mechanisms for poor mixing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Progress towards interactive steering of the time-accurate, unsteady finite-element simulation program DYNA3D is reported. Rudimentary steering has been demonstrated in a distributed computational environment encompassing a supercomputer, multiple graphics workstations, and a single frame animation recorder. The coroutine facility of AVS (application visualization system from AVS Inc.) and software produced in-house has been coordinated to prove the concept. This work also applies to other large batch-oriented FORTRAN simulations ("dusty decks") presently in production use.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Proposes an interactive method for exploring topological spaces based on the natural local geometry of the space. Examples of spaces appropriate for this visualization approach occur in abundance in mathematical visualization, surface and volume visualization problems, and scientific applications such as general relativity. Our approach is based on using a controller to choose a direction in which to "walk" a manifold along a local geodesic path. The method automatically generates orientation changes that produce a maximal viewable region with each step of the walk. The proposed interaction framework has many natural properties to help the user develop a useful cognitive map of a space and is well-suited to haptic interfaces that may be incorporated into desktop virtual reality systems.
One well known application area of volume rendering is the reconstruction and visualization of output from medical scanners like computed tomography (CT). 2D greyscale slices produced by these scanners can be reconstructed and displayed onscreen as a 3D model. Volume visualization of medical images must address two important issues. First, it is difficult to segment medical scans into individual materials based only on intensity values. Second, although greyscale images are the normal method for displaying medical volumes, these types of images are not necessarily appropriate for highlighting regions of interest within the volume. Studies of the human visual system have shown that individual intensity values are difficult to detect in a greyscale image. In these situations colour is a more effective visual feature. We addressed both problems during the visualization of CT scans of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have developed a classification method that empirically segments regions of interest in each of the 2D slices. We use a perceptual colour selection technique to identify each region of interest in both the 2D slices and the 3D reconstructed volumes. The result is a colourized volume that the radiologists are using to rapidly and accurately identify the locations and spatial interactions of different materials from their scans. Our technique is being used in an experimental post operative environment to help to evaluate the results of surgery designed to prevent the rupture of the aneurysm. In the future, we hope to use the technique during the planning of placement of support grafts prior to the actual operation.
We develop multiresolution models for analyzing and visualizing two-dimensional flows over curvilinear grids. Our models are based upon nested spaces of piecewise defined functions defined over nested curvilinear grid domains. The nested domains are selected so as to maintain the original geometry of the inner boundary. We first give the refinement and decomposition equations for Haar wavelets over these domains. Next, using lifting techniques we develop and show examples of piecewise linear wavelets over curvilinear grids.
Non-traditional applications of scientific data challenge the typical approaches to visualization. In particular popular scientific visualization strategies fail when the expertise of the data consumer is in a different field than the one that generated the data and data from the user's domain must be utilized as well. This problem occurs when predictive weather simulations are used for a number of weather-sensitive applications. A data fusion approach is adopted for visualization design and utilized for specific example problems.
Animal dissection for the scientific examination of organ subsystems is a delicate procedure. Performing this procedure under the complex environment of microgravity presents additional challenges because of the limited training opportunities available that can recreate the altered gravity environment. Traditional astronaut crew training often occurs several months in advance of experimentation, provides limited realism, and involves complicated logistics. We have developed an interactive virtual environment that can simulate several common tasks performed during animal dissection. In this paper, we describe the imaging modality used to reconstruct the rat, provide an overview of the simulation environment and briefly discuss some of the techniques used to manipulate the virtual rat.
Weather radars can measure the backscatter from rain drops in the atmosphere. A complete radar scan provides three-dimensional precipitation information. For the understanding of the underlying atmospheric processes interactive visualization of these data sets is necessary. This is a challenging task due to the size, structure and required context of the data. In this case study, a multiresolution approach for real-time simultaneous visualization of radar measurements together with the corresponding terrain data is illustrated.
In this paper we present a generic method for incremental mesh adaptation based on hierarchy of semi-regular meshes. Our method supports any refinement rule mapping vertices onto vertices such as 1-to-4 split or /spl radic/3-subdivision. Resulting adaptive mesh has subdivision connectivity and hence good aspect ratio of triangles. Hierarchic representation of the mesh allows incremental local refinement and simplification operations exploiting frame-to-frame coherence. We also present an out-of-core storage layout scheme designed for semi-regular meshes of arbitrary subdivision connectivity. It provides high cache coherency in the data retrieval and relies on the interleaved storage of resolution levels and maintaining good geometrical proximity within each level. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with applications in physically-based cloth simulation, real-time terrain visualization and procedural modeling.
We present a novel approach to interactive visualization and exploration of large unstructured tetrahedral meshes. These massive 3D meshes are used in mission-critical CFD and structural mechanics simulations, and typically sample multiple field values on several millions of unstructured grid points. Our method relies on the preprocessing of the tetrahedral mesh to partition it into nonconvex boundaries and internal fragments that are subsequently encoded into compressed multiresolution data representations. These compact hierarchical data structures are then adaptively rendered and probed in real-time on a commodity PC. Our point-based rendering algorithm, which is inspired by QSplat, employs a simple but highly efficient splatting technique that guarantees interactive frame-rates regardless of the size of the input mesh and the available rendering hardware. It furthermore allows for real-time probing of the volumetric data-set through constructive solid geometry operations as well as interactive editing of color transfer functions for an arbitrary number of field values. Thus, the presented visualization technique allows end-users for the first time to interactively render and explore very large unstructured tetrahedral meshes on relatively inexpensive hardware.
Most data used in the study of seafloor hydrothermal plumes consists of sonar (acoustic) scans and sensor readings. Visual data captures only a portion of the sonar data range due to the prohibitive cost and physical infeasibility of taking sufficient lighting and video equipment to such extreme depths. However, visual images are available from research dives and from the recent IMAX movie, volcanoes of the deep sea. In this application paper, we apply existing lighting models with forward scattering and light attenuation to the 3D sonar data in order to mimic the visual images available. These generated images are compared to existing visual images. This can help the geoscientists understand the relationship between these different data modalities and elucidate some of the mechanisms used to capture the data.
Caricatures are pieces of art depicting persons or sociological conditions in a non-veridical way. In both cases caricatures are referring to a reference model. The deviations from the reference model are the characteristic features of the depicted subject. Good caricatures exaggerate the characteristics of a subject in order to accent them. The concept of caricaturistic visualization is based on the caricature metaphor. The aim of caricaturistic visualization is an illustrative depiction of characteristics of a given dataset by exaggerating deviations from the reference model. We present the general concept of caricaturistic visualization as well as a variety of examples. We investigate different visual representations for the depiction of caricatures. Further, we present the caricature matrix, a technique to make differences between datasets easily identifiable
The pipeline model in visualization has evolved from a conceptual model of data processing into a widely used architecture for implementing visualization systems. In the process, a number of capabilities have been introduced, including streaming of data in chunks, distributed pipelines, and demand-driven processing. Visualization systems have invariably built on stateful programming technologies, and these capabilities have had to be implemented explicitly within the lower layers of a complex hierarchy of services. The good news for developers is that applications built on top of this hierarchy can access these capabilities without concern for how they are implemented. The bad news is that by freezing capabilities into low-level services expressive power and flexibility is lost. In this paper we express visualization systems in a programming language that more naturally supports this kind of processing model. Lazy functional languages support fine-grained demand-driven processing, a natural form of streaming, and pipeline-like function composition for assembling applications. The technology thus appears well suited to visualization applications. Using surface extraction algorithms as illustrative examples, and the lazy functional language Haskell, we argue the benefits of clear and concise expression combined with fine-grained, demand-driven computation. Just as visualization provides insight into data, functional abstraction provides new insight into visualization
Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects a high percentage of the population worldwide. When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time.
Partial automation of the task of designing graphical displays that effectively depict the data to be visualized through cooperative computer-aided design (CCAD) is described. This paradigm combines the strengths of manual and automated design by interspersing guiding design operations by the human user with the exploration of design alternatives by the computer. The approach is demonstrated in the context of the IVE design system, a CCAD environment for the design of scientific visualizations using a set of design rules that combine primitive visualization components in different ways. These alternatives are presented graphically to the user, who can browse through them, select the most promising visualization, and refine it manually.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A visual interface for a multimedia database management system (MDBMS) is described. DBMS query languages are linear in syntax. Although natural language interfaces have been found to be useful, natural language is ambiguous and difficult to process. For queries on standard (relational) data, these difficulties can be avoided with the use of a visual, graphical interface to guide the user in specifying the query. For image and other media data which are ambiguous in nature, natural language processing, combined with direct graphical access to the domain knowledge, is used to interpret and evaluate the natural language query. The system fully supports graphical and image input/output in different formats. The combination of visual effect and natural language specification, the support of media data, and the allowance of incremental query specification simplify the process of query specification not only for image or multimedia databases but also for all databases.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Describes ANIM3D, a 3D animation library targeted at visualizing combinatorial structures. In particular, we are interested in algorithm animation. Constructing a new view for an algorithm typically takes dozens of design iterations, and can be very time-consuming. Our library eases the programmer's burden by providing high-level constructs for performing animations, and by offering an interpretive environment that eliminates the need for recompilations. We also illustrate ANIM3D's expressiveness by developing a 3D animation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm in just 70 lines of code.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a comprehensive algorithm to construct a topologically correct triangulation of the real affine part of a rational parametric surface with few restrictions on the defining rational functions. The rational functions are allowed to be undefined on domain curves (pole curves) and at certain special points (base points), and the surface is allowed to have nodal or cuspidal self-intersections. We also recognize that for a complete display, some real points on the parametric surface may be generated only by complex parameter values, and that some finite points on the surface may be generated only by infinite parameter values; we show how to compensate for these conditions. Our techniques for handling these problems have applications in scientific visualization, rendering non-standard NURBS, and in finite-element mesh generation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The case study describes a system that allows the use of interactive volume rendering for routine clinical diagnosis. In this setup, a SGI RealityStation acts like a remote rendering system which is controlled by a user interface that was added to an existing clinical system. The paper describes some implementation aspects, including several system optimizations that were carried out in order to optimize rendering speed. Initial results are very promising; the authors present three examples of clinical findings that were made using this system. Because of the setup, clinicians are now much more aware of the possibilities that modern hardware offers for interactive volume visualization.
Describes several visualization techniques based on the notion of multi-resolution brushing to browse large 3D volume datasets. Our software is implemented using public-domain libraries, and is designed to run on average-equipped desktop computers such as a Linux machine with 32 MBytes of memory. Empirically, our system allows scientists to obtain information from a large dataset with over 8.3 million numbers in interactive time. We show that very large scientific volume datasets can be accessed and utilized without expensive hardware and software.
The paper discusses a concept for virtual reality tools for use in design reviews of mechanical products. In this discussion, the special requirements of a virtual environment are given consideration. The focus of this paper is on suggestions for the visualization and arrangement of a product, its structure, its components and their alternatives together in one environment. The realization of these concepts results in a 3D-interface that allows users, especially engineers, to evaluate different configurations of a product and gives them direct access to the product structure. By applying various visualization techniques, product components and their attributes, e.g., their price, can be brought together into one visualization. Thus, in contrast to state-of-the-art software, the product structure, three-dimensional, real-sized components, and attribute values can be combined together in 3D-visualizations. This research was done in cooperation with Christoph Brandt, member of the Heinz Nixdorf Institute's virtual reality group.
Visualization and quantification methods are being developed to analyze our acoustic images of thermal plumes containing metallic mineral particles that discharge from hot springs on the deep seafloor. The acoustic images record intensity of backscattering from the particulate matter suspended in the plumes. The visualization methods extract, classify, visualize, measure and track reconstructions of the plumes, depicted by isointensity surfaces as 3D volume objects and 2D slices. The parameters measured, including plume volume, cross sectional area, centerline location (trajectory), surface area and isosurfaces at percentages of maximum backscatter intensity, are being used to derive elements of plume behavior including expansion with height, dilution, and mechanisms of entrainment of surrounding seawater. Our aim is to compare the observational data with predictions of plume theory to test and advance models of the behavior of hydrothermal plumes through the use of multiple representations.
Applications of visualization techniques that facilitate comparison of simulation and field datasets of seafloor hydrothermal plumes are demonstrated in order to explore and confirm theories of plume behavior. In comparing these datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence. We show the comparison by performing quantitative capturing of large scale observable features. The comparisons are needed not only to improve the relevance of the simulations to the field observations, but also to enable real time adjustment of shipboard data collection systems. Our approach for comparing simulation and field datasets is to use skeletonization and centerline representation. Features representing plumes are skeletonized. Skeleton points are used to construct a centerline and to quantify plume properties on planes normal to the centerline. These skeleton points are further used to construct an idealized cone representing a plume isosurface. The difference between the plume feature and the cone is identified as protrusions of turbulent eddies. Comparison of the simulation and field data sets through these abstractions illustrates how these abstractions characterize a plume.
We present a new wavelet compression and multiresolution modeling approach for sets of contours (level sets). In contrast to previous wavelet schemes, our algorithm creates a parametrization of a scalar field induced by its contours and compactly stores this parametrization rather than function values sampled on a regular grid. Our representation is based on hierarchical polygon meshes with subdivision connectivity whose vertices are transformed into wavelet coefficients. From this sparse set of coefficients, every set of contours can be efficiently reconstructed at multiple levels of resolution. When applying lossy compression, introducing high quantization errors, our method preserves contour topology, in contrast to compression methods applied to the corresponding field function. We provide numerical results for scalar fields defined on planar domains. Our approach generalizes to volumetric domains, time-varying contours, and level sets of vector fields.
Presents a method concerning the volume rendering of fine details, such as blood vessels and nerves, from medical data. The realistic and efficient visualization of such structures is often of great medical interest, and conventional rendering techniques do not always deal with them adequately. Our method uses preprocessing to reconstruct fine details that are difficult to segment and label. It detects the presence of fine geometrical structures, such as cracks or cylinders that suggest the existence of, for example, blood vessels or nerves; the subsequent volume rendering then displays fine geometrical objects that lie on a surface. The method can also show structures within the volume, using a special "integration sampling" scheme to portray reconstructed volume texture, such as that exhibited by muscle fibers. By combining the surface structure and volume texture in the rendering, realistic results can be produced; examples are provided.
Data sets from large-scale simulations (up to 501/sup 3/ grid points) of mantle convection are analyzed with volume rendering of the temperature field and a new critical point analysis of the velocity field. As the Rayleigh number Ra is increased the thermal field develops increasingly thin plume-like structures along which heat is convected. These eventually break down and become turbulent. Visualization methods are used to distinguish between various models of heat conductivity and to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of the flow.
Area-preserving maps are found across a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. Their study is made challenging by the significant computational effort typically required for their inspection but more fundamentally by the fractal complexity of salient structures. The visual inspection of these maps reveals a remarkable topological picture consisting of fixed (or periodic) points embedded in so-called island chains, invariant manifolds, and regions of ergodic behavior. This paper is concerned with the effective visualization and precise topological analysis of area-preserving maps with two degrees of freedom from numerical or analytical data. Specifically, a method is presented for the automatic extraction and characterization of fixed points and the computation of their invariant manifolds, also known as separatrices, to yield a complete picture of the structures present within the scale and complexity bounds selected by the user. This general approach offers a significant improvement over the visual representations that are so far available for area-preserving maps. The technique is demonstrated on a numerical simulation of magnetic confinement in a fusion reactor.
Alternative models that use B-spline curves and surfaces for generating color sequences for univariate, bivariate, and trivariate mapping are introduced. The main aim is to break away from simple geometric representation in order to provide more flexibility and control over color selection. This facilitates the task of constructing a customized color scheme for a particular map. The author gives a brief description of existing color schemes and their characteristics, and provides some background for B-spline curves and surfaces.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Most of the current dataflow visualization systems are based on coarse-grain dataflow computing models. In this paper we propose a fine-grain dataflow model that takes advantage of data locality properties of many visualization algorithms. A fine-grain module works on small chunks of data one at a time by keeping a dynamically adjusted moving window on the input data stream. It is more memory efficient and has the potential of handling very large data sets without taking up all the memory resources. Two popular visualization algorithms, an iso-surface extraction algorithm and a volume rendering algorithm, are implemented using the fine-grain model. The performance measurements showed faster speed, reduced memory usage, and improved CPU utilization over a typical coarse-grain system.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Existing volume visualization techniques are typically applied to a three-dimensional grid. This presents some challenging problems in the visualization of environmental data. This data often consists of unevenly distributed samples. Typically a two-step approach is used to visualize environmental data. First the unevenly distributed sample data are modeled onto a uniform 3-D grid. This grid model is subsequently rendered using conventional grid-based visualization techniques. This paper discusses some of the limitations of this approach and highlights areas where further research is needed to improve the accuracy of visualization for environmental applications.
We describe a visualization tool to aid aircraft designers during the conceptual design stage. The conceptual design for an aircraft is defined by a vector of 10-30 parameters. The goal is to find a vector that minimizes an objective function while meeting a series of constraints. VizCraft integrates the simulation code that evaluates the design with visualizations for analyzing the design individually or in contrast to other designs. VizCraft allows the designer to easily switch between the view of a design in the form of a parameter set, and a visualization of the corresponding aircraft. The user can easily see which, if any, constraints are violated. VizCraft also allows the user to view a database of designs using parallel coordinates.
To display the intuitive meaning of an abstract metric it is helpful to look on an embedded surface with the same inner geometry as the given metric. The resulting partial differential equations have no standard solution. Only for some special cases satisfactory methods are known. I present a new algorithmic approach which is not based on differential equations. In contrast to other methods this technique also works if the embedding exists only locally. The fundamental idea is to estimate Euclidean distances, from which the surface is built up. In this paper I focus on the reconstruction of a surface from these estimated distances. Particular the influence of a perturbation of the distances on the shape of the resulting surface is investigated.
This paper is a documentation of techniques invented, results obtained and lessons learned while creating visualization algorithms to render outputs of large-scale seismic simulations. The objective is the development of techniques for a collaborative simulation and visualization shared between structural engineers, seismologists, and computer scientists. The computer graphics research community has been witnessing a large number of exemplary publications addressing the challenges faced while trying to visualize both large-scale surface and volumetric datasets lately. From a visualization perspective, issues like data preprocessing (simplification, sampling, filtering, etc.); rendering algorithms (surface and volume), and interaction paradigms (large-scale, highly interactive, highly immersive, etc.) have been areas of study. In this light, we outline and describe the milestones achieved in a large-scale simulation and visualization project, which opened the scope for combining existing techniques with new methods, especially in those cases where no existing methods were suitable. We elucidate the data simplification and reorganization schemes that we used, and discuss the problems we encountered and the solutions we found. We describe both desktop (high-end local as well as remote) interfaces and immersive visualization systems that we developed to employ interactive surface and volume rendering algorithms. Finally, we describe the results obtained, challenges that still need to be addressed, and ongoing efforts to meet the challenges of large-scale visualization.
Ocean model simulations commonly assume the ocean is hydrostatic, resulting in near zero vertical motion. The vertical motion found is typically associated with the variations of the thermocline depth over time, which are mainly a result of the development and movement of ocean fronts, eddies, and internal waves. A new technique, extended from Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection, is presented to help understand the variation of vertical motion associated with the change in thermocline depth over time. A time surface is correctly deformed in a single direction according to the flow. The evolution of the time surface is computed via a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. The dominant horizontal motion is textured onto the surface using texture advection, while both the horizontal and vertical motions are used to displace the surface. The resulting surface is shaded for enhanced contrast. Timings indicate that the overhead over standard 2D texture advection is no more than 12%.
In this paper a new quadric-based view-dependent simplification scheme is presented. The scheme provides a method to connect mesh simplification controlled by a quadric error metric with a level-of-detail hierarchy that is accessed continuously and efficiently based on current view parameters. A variety of methods for determining the screen-space metric for the view calculation are implemented and evaluated, including an appearance-preserving method that has both geometry- and texture-preserving aspects. Results are presented and compared for a variety of models.
An ideal visualization tool that has not been used before in studying the optical behavior of near-field apertures is three-dimensional vector field topology. The global view of the vector field structure is deduced by locating singularities (critical points) within the field and augmenting these points with nearby streamlines. We have used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, three-dimensional topology to analyze the topological differences between a resonant C-shaped nano-aperture and various nonresonant conventional apertures. The topological differences between these apertures are related to the superiority in power throughput of the C-aperture versus conventional round and square sub-wavelength apertures. We demonstrate how topological visualization techniques provide significant insight into the energy enhancement mechanism of the C aperture, and also shed light on critical issues related to the interaction between multiple apertures located in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to cross-talk, for example as a function of distance. Topological techniques allow us to develop design rules for the geometry of these apertures and their desired spot sizes and brightness. The performance of various sub-wavelength apertures can also be compared quantitatively based on their topology. Since topological methods are generically applicable to tensor and vector fields, our approach can be readily extended to provide insight into the broader category of finite-difference-time-domain nano-photonics and nano-science problems.
The continuing advancement of plasma science is central to realizing fusion as an inexpensive and safe energy source. Gryokinetic simulations of plasmas are fundamental to the understanding of turbulent transport in fusion plasma. This work discusses the visualization challenges presented by gyrokinetic simulations using magnetic field line following coordinates, and presents an effective solution exploiting programmable graphics hardware to enable interactive volume visualization of 3D plasma flow on a toroidal coordinate system. The new visualization capability can help scientists better understand three-dimensional structures of the modeled phenomena. Both the limitations and future promise of the hardware-accelerated approach are also discussed.
In this application paper, we report on over fifteen years of experience with relativistic and astrophysical visualization, which has been culminating in a substantial engagement for visualization in the Einstein Year 2005 - the 100/sup th/ anniversary of Einstein's publications on special relativity, the photoelectric effect, and Brownian motion. This paper focuses on explanatory and illustrative visualizations used to communicate aspects of the difficult theories of special and general relativity, their geometric structure, and of the related fields of cosmology and astrophysics. We discuss visualization strategies, motivated by physics education and didactics of mathematics, and describe what kind of visualization methods have proven to be useful for different types of media, such as still images in popular-science magazines, film contributions to TV shows, oral presentations, or interactive museum installations. Although our visualization tools build upon existing methods and implementations, these techniques have been improved by several novel technical contributions like image-based special relativistic rendering on GPUs, an extension of general relativistic ray tracing to manifolds described by multiple charts, GPU-based interactive visualization of gravitational light deflection, as well as planetary terrain rendering. The usefulness and effectiveness of our visualizations are demonstrated by reporting on experiences with, and feedback from, recipients of visualizations and collaborators.
In this work we develop a new alternative to conventional maps for visualization of relatively short paths as they are frequently encountered in hotels, resorts or museums. Our approach is based on a warped rendering of a 3D model of the environment such that the visualized path appears to be straight even though it may contain several junctions. This has the advantage that the beholder of the image gains a realistic impression of the surroundings along the way which makes it easy to retrace the route in practice. We give an intuitive method for generation of such images and present results from user studies undertaken to evaluate the benefit of the warped images for orientation in unknown environments.
When visualizing tubular 3D structures, external representations are often used for guidance and display, and such views in 2D can often contain occlusions. Virtual dissection methods have been proposed where the entire 3D structure can be mapped to the 2D plane, though these will lose context by straightening curved sections. We present a new method of creating maps of 3D tubular structures that yield a succinct view while preserving the overall geometric structure. Given a dominant view plane for the structure, its curve skeleton is first projected to a 2D skeleton. This 2D skeleton is adjusted to account for distortions in length, modified to remove intersections, and optimized to preserve the shape of the original 3D skeleton. Based on this shaped 2D skeleton, a boundary for the map of the object is obtained based on a slicing path through the structure and the radius around the skeleton. The sliced structure is conformally mapped to a rectangle and then deformed via harmonic mapping to match the boundary placement. This flattened map preserves the general geometric context of a 3D object in a 2D display, and rendering of this flattened map can be accomplished using volumetric ray casting. We have evaluated our method on real datasets of human colon models.
A general method for rendering isosurfaces of multivariate rational and polynomial tensor products is described. The method is robust up to degree 15, handling singularities without introducing spurious rendering artifacts. The approach does not solve the problem of singularities in general, but it removes the problem from the rendering domain to the interpolation/approximation domain. It is based on finding real roots of a polynomial in Bernstein form. This makes it particularly suitable for parallel and pipelined processing. It is envisioned that the tensor products will be used as approximants or interpolants for empirical data or scalar fields. An interpolation scheme is given as an example.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Shading is an effective exploratory visualization tool widely used in scientific visualization. Interactive, or close to interactive, shading of images offers significant benefit, but is generally too computationally expensive for graphics workstations. A novel method for providing interactive diffuse and specular shading capability on low-cost graphics workstations is described. Application to digital elevation models, iso-surfaces in volumetric images, and color-coded aspect maps are illustrated and an analysis of artifacts, and of ways of minimizing artifacts, is given.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The ordinarily arid climate of coastal Peru is disturbed every few years by a phenomenon called El Nino, characterized by a warming in the Pacific Ocean. Severe rainstorms are one of the consequences of El Nino, which cause great damage. An examination of daily data from 66 rainfall stations in the Chiura-Piura region of northwestern Peru from late 1982 through mid-1983 (associated with an El Nino episode) yields information on the mesoscale structure of these storms. These observational data are typical of a class that are scattered at irregular locations in two dimensions. The use of continuous realization techniques for qualitative visualization (e.g., surface deformation or contouring) requires an intermediate step to define a topological relationship between the locations of data to form a mesh structure. Several common methods are considered, and the results of their application to the study of the rainfall events are analyzed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper describes an approach for interactive visualization of mixed scalar and vector fields, in which vector icons are generated from pre-voxelized icon templates and volume-rendered together with the volumetric scalar data. This approach displays simultaneously the global structure of the scalar field and the detailed features of the vector field. Interactive visualization is achieved with incremental image update, by re-rendering only a small portion of the image wherever and whenever a change occurs. This technique supports a set of interactive visualization tools, including change of vector field visualization parameters, real-time animation of vector icons advected within the scalar field, a zooming lens, and a local probe.
Because of the nature of the die casting process, the part geometry severely restricts the die geometry and hence affects the quality of the part. However, as is often the case in other manufacturing processes, diecastings are currently designed purely based on their function. The manufacturability of the diecastings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. This is due to the design support limitations of current CAE tools. We present a new volume-based approach to support diecastability evaluation, especially in preliminary design. Our approach can be applied to arbitrarily shaped parts without pre-defined feature libraries. The focus is on the identification of geometric characteristics, e.g. heavy mass regions, that could be responsible for thermal-related part defects. A distance transform with city-block metric is used to extract this geometric property. Volume visualization techniques are also adopted to allow users to visualize the results in a clear and precise way.
The vast quantities of data which may be produced by modern radio telescopes have outstripped conventional visualisation techniques available to astronomers. While research in other areas of visualisation finds some application in astronomy, problems peculiar to the field require new techniques. This paper presents a brief overview of some of the problems of visualisation for astronomy and compares different shading algorithms. A more comprehensive overview may be found in Norris (1994) and Gooch (1995).
In many mechanical design-related activities, the visualization tool needs to convey not only the shape of the objects, but also their interior problem regions. Due to the binary nature of these models, existing shading models often fall short of supporting a realistic display. In this case study, we present several new contextual shading methods that we originally developed for our design visualization tools. The results are then compared with gray-scale shading applied to a gray-level version of the binary object. The comparison shows that our method can be applied to any binary object and yields promising results.
A computer animated movie was produced, illustrating both 2D and 3D Hilbert curves, and showing the transition from 2D to 3D with the help of volume rendering.
Visualization systems are complex dynamic software systems. Debugging such systems is difficult using conventional debuggers because the programmer must try to imagine the three-dimensional geometry based on a list of positions and attributes. In addition, the programmer must be able to mentally animate changes in those positions and attributes to grasp dynamic behaviors within the algorithm. We show that representing geometry, attributes, and relationships graphically permits visual pattern recognition skills to be applied to the debugging problem. The particular application is a particle system used for isosurface extraction from volumetric data. Coloring particles based on individual attributes is especially helpful when these colorings are viewed as animations over successive iterations in the program. Although we describe a particular application, the types of tools that we discuss can be applied to a variety of problems.
The microscopic analysis of time dependent 3D live cells provides considerable challenges to visualization. Effective visualization can provide insight into the structure and functioning of living cells. The paper presents a case study in which a number of visualization techniques were applied to analyze a specific problem in cell biology: the condensation and de-condensation of chromosomes during cell division. The spatial complexity of the data required sophisticated presentation techniques. The interactive virtual reality enabled visualization system, proteus, specially equipped for time dependent 3D data sets is described. An important feature of proteus is that it is extendible to cope with application-specific demands.
We have created an application, called PRIMA (Patient Record intelligent Monitoring and Analysis), which can be used to visualize and understand patient record data. It was developed to better understand a large collection of patient records of bone marrow transplants at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. It is based on an information visualization toolkit, Opal, which has been developed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. Opal allows intelligent, interactive visualization of a wide variety of different types of data. The PRIMA application is generally applicable to a wide range of patient record data, as the underlying toolkit is flexible with regard to the form of the input data. This application is a good example of the usefulness of information visualization techniques in the bioinformatics domain, as these techniques have been developed specifically to deal with diverse sets of often unfamiliar data. We illustrate several unanticipated findings which resulted from the use of a flexible and interactive information visualization environment.
The quality of volume visualization depends strongly on the quality of the underlying data. In virtual colonoscopy, CT data should be acquired at a low radiation dose that results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Alternatively, MRI data is acquired without ionizing radiation, but suffers from noise and bias (global signal fluctuations). Current volume visualization techniques often do not produce good results with noisy or biased data. This paper describes methods for volume visualization that deal with these imperfections. The techniques are based on specially adapted edge detectors using first and second order derivative filters. The filtering is integrated into the visualization process. The first order derivative method results in good quality images but suffers from localization bias. The second order method has better surface localization, especially in highly curved areas. It guarantees minimal detail smoothing resulting in a better visualization of polyps.
Multimedia objects are often described by high-dimensional feature vectors which can be used for retrieval and clustering tasks. We have built an interactive retrieval system for 3D model databases that implements a variety of different feature transforms. Recently, we have enhanced the functionality of our system by integrating a SOM-based visualization module. In this poster demo, we show how 2D maps can be used to improve the effectiveness of retrieval, clustering, and over-viewing tasks in a 3D multimedia system.
Differential protein expression analysis is one of the main challenges in proteomics. It denotes the search for proteins, whose encoding genes are differentially expressed under a given experimental setup. An important task in this context is to identify the differentially expressed proteins or, more generally, all proteins present in the sample. One of the most promising and recently widely used approaches for protein identification is to cleave proteins into peptides, separate the peptides using liquid chromatography, and determine the masses of the separated peptides using mass spectrometry. The resulting data needs to be analyzed and matched against protein sequence databases. The analysis step is typically done by searching for intensity peaks in a large number of 2D graphs. We present an interactive visualization tool for the exploration of liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry data in a 3D space, which allows for the understanding of the data in its entirety and a detailed analysis of regions of interest. We compute differential expression over the liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry domain and embed it visually in our system. Our exploration tool can treat single liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry data sets as well as data acquired using multi-dimensional protein identification technology. For efficiency purposes we perform a peak-preserving data resampling and multiresolution hierarchy generation prior to visualization.
It is a challenging task to visualize the behavior of time-dependent 3D vector fields. Most of the time an overview of unsteady fields is provided via animations, but, unfortunately, animations provide only transient impressions of momentary flow. In this paper we present two approaches to visualize time varying fields with fixed geometry. Path lines and streak lines represent such a steady visualization of unsteady vector fields, but because of occlusion and visual clutter it is useless to draw them all over the spatial domain. A selection is needed. We show how bundles of streak lines and path lines, running at different times through one point in space, like through an eyelet, yield an insightful visualization of flow structure ("eyelet lines"). To provide a more intuitive and appealing visualization we also explain how to construct a surface from these lines. As second approach, we use a simple measurement of local changes of a field over time to determine regions with strong changes. We visualize these regions with isosurfaces to give an overview of the activity in the dataset. Finally we use the regions as a guide for placing eyelets.
Many interesting and promising prototypes for visualizing video data have been proposed, including those that combine videos with their spatial context (contextualized videos). However, relatively little work has investigated the fundamental design factors behind these prototypes in order to provide general design guidance. Focusing on real-time video data visualization, we evaluated two important design factors - video placement method and spatial context presentation method - through a user study. In addition, we evaluated the effect of spatial knowledge of the environment. Participantspsila performance was measured through path reconstruction tasks, where the participants followed a target through simulated surveillance videos and marked the target paths on the environment model. We found that embedding videos inside the model enabled realtime strategies and led to faster performance. With the help of contextualized videos, participants not familiar with the real environment achieved similar task performance to participants that worked in that environment. We discuss design implications and provide general design recommendations for traffic and security surveillance system interfaces.
Many visualization applications benefit from displaying content on real-world objects rather than on a traditional display (e.g., a monitor). This type of visualization display is achieved by projecting precisely controlled illumination from multiple projectors onto the real-world colored objects. For such a task, the placement of the projectors is critical in assuring that the desired visualization is possible. Using ad hoc projector placement may cause some appearances to suffer from color shifting due to insufficient projector light radiance being exposed onto the physical surface. This leads to an incorrect appearance and ultimately to a false and potentially misleading visualization. In this paper, we present a framework to discover the optimal position and orientation of the projectors for such projection-based visualization displays. An optimal projector placement should be able to achieve the desired visualization with minimal projector light radiance. When determining optimal projector placement, object visibility, surface reflectance properties, and projector-surface distance and orientation need to be considered. We first formalize a theory for appearance editing image formation and construct a constrained linear system of equations that express when a desired novel appearance or visualization is possible given a geometric and surface reflectance model of the physical surface. Then, we show how to apply this constrained system in an adaptive search to efficiently discover the optimal projector placement which achieves the desired appearance. Constraints can be imposed on the maximum radiance allowed by the projectors and the projectors' placement to support specific goals of various visualization applications. We perform several real-world and simulated appearance edits and visualizations to demonstrate the improvement obtained by our discovered projector placement over ad hoc projector placement.
Special relativistic visualization offers the possibility of experiencing the optical effects of traveling near the speed of light, including apparent geometric distortions as well as Doppler and searchlight effects. Early high-quality computer graphics images of relativistic scenes were created using offline, computationally expensive CPU-side 4D ray tracing. Alternate approaches such as image-based rendering and polygon-distortion methods are able to achieve interactivity, but exhibit inferior visual quality due to sampling artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid rendering technique based on polygon distortion and local ray tracing that facilitates interactive high-quality visualization of multiple objects moving at relativistic speeds in arbitrary directions. The method starts by calculating tight image-space footprints for the apparent triangles of the 3D scene objects. The final image is generated using a single image-space ray tracing step incorporating Doppler and searchlight effects. Our implementation uses GPU shader programming and hardware texture filtering to achieve high rendering speed.
Analyzing either high-frequency shape detail or any other 2D fields (scalar or vector) embedded over a 3D geometry is a complex task, since detaching the detail from the overall shape can be tricky. An alternative approach is to move to the 2D space, resolving shape reasoning to easier image processing techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for the analysis of 2D information distributed over 3D geometry, based on a locally smooth parametrization technique that allows us to treat local 3D data in terms of image content. The proposed approach has been implemented as a sketch-based system that allows to design with a few gestures a set of (possibly overlapping) parameterizations of rectangular portions of the surface. We demonstrate that, due to the locality of the parametrization, the distortion is under an acceptable threshold, while discontinuities can be avoided since the parametrized geometry is always homeomorphic to a disk. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to solve specific Cultural Heritage (CH) tasks: the analysis of chisel marks over the surface of a unfinished sculpture and the local comparison of multiple photographs mapped over the surface of an artwork. For this very difficult task, we believe that our framework and the corresponding tool are the first steps toward a computer-based shape reasoning system, able to support CH scholars with a medium they are more used to.
The author presents a simple, procedural interface for volume rendering. The interface is built on three types of objects: volumes, which contain the data to be visualized, environments, which set up viewing and lighting, and image objects, which convert results to a user-definable format. A volume is rendered against a particular environment with the results sent to an image object for conversion. By defining volume qualities such as color, opacity, and gradient in terms of user-definable transfer functions, the rendering process is made independent of the data set's underlying representation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Blood movement investigated by magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping is generally presented in the form of velocity components in one or more chosen velocity encoding directions. By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for MR practitioners to conceptualize and comprehend the underlying flow structures, especially when the image data have strong background noise. A flow visualization technique that adapts the idea of particle tracing used in classical fluid dynamics for visualizing flow is presented. The flow image processing relies on the strong correlation between the principal flow direction estimated from the distribution of the modulus of the velocity field and the direction derived from the raw image data. By correlation calculation, severe background noise can be eliminated. Flow pattern rendering and animation provide an efficient way for representing internal flow structures.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Techniques for visualizing a simulated air flow in a clean room are developed by using an efficient cell traverse of tetrahedral cells generated from irregular volumes. The proposed techniques, probing and stream line display, are related to the measurement techniques used in actual clean rooms. The efficient traverse makes it possible to move freely around a given irregular volume and to spawn off stream lines. A successful application of these techniques to a problem in a clean room is also described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Invariant tori are examples of invariant manifolds in dynamical systems. Usual tools in dynamical systems such as analysis and numerical simulations alone are often not sufficient to understand the complicated mechanisms that cause changes in these manifolds. Computer-graphical visualization is a natural and powerful addition to these tools used for the qualitative study of dynamical systems, especially for the study of invariant manifolds. The dynamics of two linearly coupled oscillators is the focus of this case study. With little or no coupling between the oscillators, an invariant torus is present but it breaks down for strong coupling. Visualization has been employed to gain a qualitative understanding of this breakdown process. The visualization has allowed key features of the tori to be recognized, and it has proven to be indispensable in developing and testing hypotheses about the tori.
The antenna of a cellular telephone in close proximity to the human head for a variety of time periods raises questions. This research uses the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to calculate the power deposition from a cellular telephone on a high-resolution model of a human head as measured by the specific absorption rates (SAR) in W/kg. Visualization has been used to verify the modeling for simulation, assisted in analyzing the data and understanding the physical aspects controlling the power absorption.
Visualization of computational oceanography is traditionally a post-processing step. This batch orientation is clumsy if one wants to observe the effect of a wide range of parameters on the solution. This paper describes the conversion of an ocean circulation model from this traditional design to an interactive program in which the computed solution is viewed in real-time over a wide-area network and the user is given the ability to change the model parameters and immediately observe the impact this has on the solution.
We present a new approach for simplifying models composed of polygons or spline patches. Given an input model, the algorithm computes a new representation of the model in terms of triangular Bezier patches. It performs a series of geometric operations, consisting of patch merging and swapping diagonals, and makes use of batch connectivity information to generate C-LODs (curved levels-of-detail). Each C-LOD is represented using cubic triangular Bezier patches. The C-LODs provide a compact representation for storing the model. The algorithm tries to minimize the surface deviation error and maintains continuity at patch boundaries. Given the CLODs, the algorithm can generate their polygonal approximations using static and dynamic tessellation schemes. It has been implemented and we highlight its performance on a number of polygonal and spline models.
Global circulation models are used to gain an understanding of the processes that affect the Earth's climate and may ultimately be used to assess the impact of humanity's activities on it. The POP ocean model developed at Los Alamos is an example of such a global circulation model that is being used to investigate the role of the ocean in the climate system. Data output from POP has traditionally been visualized using video technology which precludes rapid modification of visualization parameters and techniques. This paper describes a visualization system that leverages high speed graphics hardware, specifically texture mapping hardware, to accelerate data exploration to interactive rates. We describe the design of the system, the specific hardware features used, and provide examples of its use. The system is capable of viewing ocean circulation simulation results at up to 60 frames per second while loading texture memory at approximately 72 million texels per second.
Analyzing options is a complex, multi-variate process. Option behavior depends on a variety of market conditions which vary over the time course of the option. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive visual environment which allows the analyst to explore these complex interactions, and to select and construct specific views for communicating information to non-analysts (e.g., marketing managers and customers). In this paper we describe an environment for exploring 2- and 3-dimensional representations of options data, dynamically varying parameters, examining how multi-variate relationships develop over time, and exploring the likelihood of the development of different outcomes over the life of the option. We also demonstrate how this tool has been used by analysts to communicate to non-analysts how particular options no longer deliver the behavior they were originally intended to provide.
This is basic research for assigning color values to voxels of multichannel MRI volume data. The MRI volume data sets obtained under different scanning conditions are transformed into their components by independent component analysis (ICA), which enhances the physical characteristics of the tissue. The transfer functions for generating color values from independent components are obtained using a radial basis function network, a kind of neural net, by training the network with sample data chosen from the Visible Female data set. The resultant color volume data sets correspond well with the full-color cross-sections of the Visible Human data sets.
Multi-dimensional entities are modeled, displayed and understood with a new algorithm vectorizing data of any dimensionality. This algorithm is called SBP; it is a vectorized generalization of parallel coordinates. Classic geometries of any dimensionality can be demonstrated to facilitate perception and understanding of the shapes generated by this algorithm. SBP images of a 4D line, a circle and 3D and 4D spherical helices are shown. A strategy for synthesizing multi-dimensional models matching multi-dimensional data is presented. Current applications include data mining; modeling data-defined structures of scientific interest such as protein structure and Calabi-Yau figures as multi-dimensional geometric entities; generating vector-fused data signature fingerprints of classic frequency spectra that identify substances; and treating complex targets as multi-dimensional entities for automatic target recognition. SBP vector data signatures apply to all pattern recognition problems.
The case study presents a medical Web service for the automatic analysis of CTA (computer tomography angiography) datasets. It aims at the detection and evaluation of intracranial aneurysms which are malformations of cerebral blood vessels. To obtain a standardized 3D visualization, digital videos are automatically generated. The time-consuming video production caused by the manual delineation of structures, software based volume rendering, and the interactive definition of an optimized camera path is considerably improved with a fully automatic strategy. Therefore, a previously suggested approach (C. Rezk-Salama, 2000) is applied which uses an optimized transfer function as a template and automatically adapts it to an individual dataset. Furthermore, we introduce hardware-accelerated morphologic filtering in order to detect the location of mid-size and giant aneurysms. The actual generation of the video is finally integrated into a hardware accelerated off-screen rendering process based on 3D texture mapping, ensuring fast visualization of high quality. Overall, clinical routine can be considerably assisted by providing a Web based service combining automatic detection and standardized visualization.
Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is a promising method for visualizing 2D dense flow fields. Direct extensions of the LIC method to 3D have not been considered very effective, because optical integration in viewing directions tends to spoil the coherent structures along 3D local streamlines. In our previous reports, we have proposed a selective approach to volume rendering of LIC solid texture using 3D significance map (S-map), derived from the characteristics of flow structures, and a specific illumination model for 3D streamlines. In this paper, we take full advantage of scalar volume rendering hardware, such as VolumePro, to realize a realtime 3D flow field visualization environment with the LIC volume rendering method.

This paper describes a tool for the visualization of T/sub 2/ maps of knee cartilage. Given the anatomical scan, and the T/sub 2/ map of the cartilage, we combine the information on the shape and the quality of the cartilage in a single image. The Profile Flag is an intuitive 3D glyph for probing and annotating of the underlying data. It comprises a bulletin board pin-like shape with a small flag on top of it. While moving the glyph along the reconstructed surface of an object, the curve data measured along the pin's needle and in its neighborhood are shown on the flag. The application area of the Profile Flag is manifold, enabling the visualization of profile data of dense but in-homogeneous objects. Furthermore, it extracts the essential part of the data without removing or even reducing the context information. By sticking Profile Flags into the investigated structure, one or more significant locations can be annotated by showing the local characteristics of the data at that locations. In this paper we are demonstrating the properties of the tool by visualizing T/sub 2/ maps of knee cartilage.
Today's PCs incorporate multiple CPUs and GPUs and are easily arranged in clusters for high-performance, interactive graphics. We present an approach based on hierarchical, screen-space tiles to parallelizing rendering with level of detail. Adapt tiles, render tiles, and machine tiles are associated with CPUs, GPUs, and PCs, respectively, to efficiently parallelize the workload with good resource utilization. Adaptive tile sizes provide load balancing while our level of detail system allows total and independent management of the load on CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate our approach on parallel configurations consisting of both single PCs and a cluster of PCs.
Marching cubes is the most popular isosurface extraction algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency and robustness. It has been widely studied, improved, and extended. While much early work was concerned with efficiency and correctness issues, lately there has been a push to improve the quality of marching cubes meshes so that they can be used in computational codes. In this work we present a new classification of MC cases that we call edge groups, which helps elucidate the issues that impact the triangle quality of the meshes that the method generates. This formulation allows a more systematic way to bound the triangle quality, and is general enough to extend to other polyhedral cell shapes used in other polygonization algorithms. Using this analysis, we also discuss ways to improve the quality of the resulting triangle mesh, including some that require only minor modifications of the original algorithm.
Practical volume visualization pipelines are never without compromises and errors. A delicate and often-studied component is the interpolation of off-grid samples, where aliasing can lead to misleading artifacts and blurring, potentially hiding fine details of critical importance. The verifiable visualization framework we describe aims to account for these errors directly in the volume generation stage, and we specifically target volumetric data obtained via computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. In this case the raw data are the X-ray projections obtained from the scanner and the volume data generation process is the CT algorithm. Our framework informs the CT reconstruction process of the specific filter intended for interpolation in the subsequent visualization process, and this in turn ensures an accurate interpolation there at a set tolerance. Here, we focus on fast trilinear interpolation in conjunction with an octree-type mixed resolution volume representation without T-junctions. Efficient rendering is achieved by a space-efficient and locality-optimized representation, which can straightforwardly exploit fast fixed-function pipelines on GPUs.
Software developed to deal with differing image file formats, mismatched byte order and word sizes, and confusing hardcopy device interfaces is described. The SDSC Image Tool suite provides a simple, extensible, and portable mechanism for the support of a variety of common image formats so that tool-writers can concentrate on the task in hand, rather than on the quirks of a particular image file format. Users of such tools are able to work with images generated from a variety of sources, without being restricted to an arbitrary standard format. The SDSC Visualization Printing suite creates a unified view of hardcopy devices.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In the automotive industry, it is highly important that the exterior body panels be esthetically pleasing. One aspect of creating esthetically pleasing surfaces is to require that they be fair. A system that has proven useful for diagnosis of surface fairness problems is presented. How to choose a set of colors with perceptually uniform spacing is described, and the usefulness of a logarithmic scale for relating curvature to colors is shown.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visual realism is necessary for many virtual reality applications. In order to convince the user that the virtual environment is real, the scene presented should faithfully model the expected actual environment. A highly accurate, fully modeled, interactive environment is thus seen as "virtually real". The paper addresses the problem of interactive visual realism and discusses a possible solution: a hybrid rendering paradigm that ties distributed graphics hardware and ray tracing systems together for use in interactive, high visual realism applications. This new paradigm is examined in the context of a working rendering system. This system is capable of producing images of higher fidelity than possible through the use of graphics hardware alone, able both to render images at speeds useful for interactive systems and to progressively refine static, high quality snapshots.
We describe an on-going project that is using visualization as an indispensable tool for the restoration of the disintegrated ceiling of a ritual precinct that was discovered during archaeological excavations of a group of pre-Inca temples in Peru. This ceiling is unique-it is the only one ever found that has pictures painted on it, rather than being simply white-washed. The restoration of the ceiling, and the recovery of these iconographic figures will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the culture of the Moche people who build and used these temples.
This paper investigates the visualization and animation of geometric computing in a distributed electronic classroom. We show how focusing in a well-defined domain makes it possible to develop a compact system that is accessible to even naive users. We present a conceptual model and a system, GASP-II (Geometric Animation System, Princeton, II), that realizes this model in the geometric domain. The system allows the presentation and interactive exploration of 3D geometric algorithms over a network.
We define a rotation field by extending the notion of a vector field to rotations. A vector field has a vector as a value at each point of its domain; a rotation field has a rotation as a value at each point of its domain. Rotation fields result from mapping the orientation error of tracking systems. We build upon previous methods for the visualization of vector fields, tensor fields and rotations at a point, to visualize a rotation field resulting from calibration of a commonly-used magnetic tracking system.
In this article, we build a multi-resolution framework intended to be used for the visualization of continuous piecewise linear functions defined over triangular planar or spherical meshes. In particular, the data set can be viewed at different level of detail, that's to say as a piecewise linear function defined over any simplification of the base mesh. In his multi-resolution form, the function requires strictly the same volume of data than the original input: It is then possible to go through consecutive levels by the use of so-called detail coefficients, with exact reconstruction if desired. We also show how to choose a decimation sequence that leads to a good compromise between the resulting approximation error and the number of removed vertices. The theoretical tools used here are inspired from wavelet-based techniques and extended in the sense that they can handle non-nested approximation spaces.
We consider interpolation between keyframe hierarchies. We impose a set of weak constraints that allows smooth interpolation between two keyframe hierarchies in an animation or, more generally, allows the interpolation in an n-parameter family of hierarchies. We use hierarchical triangulations obtained by the Rivara element bisection algorithm (M. Rivara, 1984) and impose a weak compatibility constraint on the set of root elements of all keyframe hierarchies. We show that the introduced constraints are rather weak. The strength of our approach is that the interpolation works in the class of conforming triangulations and simplifies the task of finding the intermediate hierarchy, which is the union of the two (or more) keyframe hierarchies involved in the interpolation process. This allows for an efficient generation of the intermediate connectivity and additionally ensures that the intermediate hierarchy is again a conforming hierarchy satisfying the same constraints.


The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiment at the Brookhaven National Lab is designed to study how the universe came into being. It is believed that after the Big Bang, the universe expanded and cooled, consisting of a soup of quarks, gluons, electrons and neutrinos. As the temperature lowered, electrons combined with protons and formed neutral atoms. Later, clouds of atoms contracted into stars. In this paper, we describe how techniques of volume rendering and information visualization are used to visualize the large particle track data set generated from this high energy physics experiment. The system, called TrackVis, is based on our earlier work of VolVis - Volume Visualization software. Example images of real particle collision data are shown, which are helpful to physicists in investigating the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high energy density.
The complex geometry of the human brain contains many folds and fissures, making it impossible to view the entire surface at once. Since most of the cortical activity occurs on these folds, it is desirable to be able to view the entire surface of the brain in a single view. This can be achieved using quasi-conformal flat maps of the cortical surface. Computational and visualization tools are now needed to be able to interact with these flat maps of the brain to gain information about spatial and functional relationships that might not otherwise be apparent. Such information can contribute to earlier diagnostic tools for diseases and improved treatment. Our group is developing visualization and analysis tools that will help elucidate new information about the human brain through the interaction between a cortical surface and its corresponding quasiconformal flat map.
This case study describes the process of fusing the data from several wind tunnel experiments into a single coherent visualization. Each experiment was conducted independently and was designed to explore different flow features around airplane landing gear. In the past, it would have been very difficult to correlate results from the different experiments. However, with a single 3-D visualization representing the fusion of the three experiments, significant insight into the composite flowfield was observed that would have been extremely difficult to obtain by studying its component parts. The results are even more compelling when viewed in an immersive environment.
We describe an animated electro-holographic visualization of brain lesions due to the progression of multiple sclerosis. A research case study is used which documents the expression of visible brain lesions in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes collected over the interval of one year. Some of the salient information resident within this data is described, and the motivation for using a dynamic spatial display to explore its spatial and temporal characteristics is stated. We provide a brief overview of spatial displays in medical imaging applications, and then describe our experimental visualization pipeline, from the processing of MRI datasets, through model construction, computer graphic rendering, and hologram encoding. The utility, strengths and shortcomings of the electro-holographic visualization are described and future improvements are suggested.
We propose a novel persistent octree (POT) indexing structure for accelerating isosurface extraction and spatial filtering from volumetric data. This data structure efficiently handles a wide range of visualization problems such as the generation of view-dependent isosurfaces, ray tracing, and isocontour slicing for high dimensional data. POT can be viewed as a hybrid data structure between the interval tree and the branch-on-need octree (BONO) in the sense that it achieves the asymptotic bound of the interval tree for identifying the active cells corresponding to an isosurface and is more efficient than BONO for handling spatial queries. We encode a compact octree for each isovalue. Each such octree contains only the corresponding active cells, in such a way that the combined structure has linear space. The inherent hierarchical structure associated with the active cells enables very fast filtering of the active cells based on spatial constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing view-dependent isosurfacing on a wide variety of volumetric data sets and 4D isocontour slicing on the time-varying Richtmyer-Meshkov instability dataset
Radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a powerful automatic remote identification technique that has wide applications. To facilitate RFID deployment, an RFID benchmarking instrument called aGate has been invented to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different RFID technologies in various environments. However, the data acquired by aGate are usually complex time varying multidimensional 3D volumetric data, which are extremely challenging for engineers to analyze. In this paper, we introduce a set of visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinate plots, orientation plots, a visual history mechanism, and a 3D spatial viewer, to help RFID engineers analyze benchmark data visually and intuitively. With the techniques, we further introduce two workflow procedures (a visual optimization procedure for finding the optimum reader antenna configuration and a visual analysis procedure for comparing the performance and identifying the flaws of RFID devices) for the RFID benchmarking, with focus on the performance analysis of the aGate system. The usefulness and usability of the system are demonstrated in the user evaluation.
In this paper we present a method for vortex core line extraction which operates directly on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) representation and, by this, generates smoother and more (spatially and temporally) coherent results in an efficient way. The underlying predictor-corrector scheme is general enough to be applied to other line-type features and it is extendable to the extraction of surfaces such as isosurfaces or Lagrangian coherent structures. The proposed method exploits temporal coherence to speed up computation for subsequent time steps. We show how the predictor-corrector formulation can be specialized for several variants of vortex core line definitions including two recent unsteady extensions, and we contribute a theoretical and practical comparison of these. In particular, we reveal a close relation between unsteady extensions of Fuchs et al. and Weinkauf et al. and we give a proof of the Galilean invariance of the latter. When visualizing SPH data, there is the possibility to use the same interpolation method for visualization as has been used for the simulation. This is different from the case of finite volume simulation results, where it is not possible to recover from the results the spatial interpolation that was used during the simulation. Such data are typically interpolated using the basic trilinear interpolant, and if smoothness is required, some artificial processing is added. In SPH data, however, the smoothing kernels are specified from the simulation, and they provide an exact and smooth interpolation of data or gradients at arbitrary points in the domain.
Multi-valued data sets are increasingly common, with the number of dimensions growing. A number of multi-variate visualization techniques have been presented to display such data. However, evaluating the utility of such techniques for general data sets remains difficult. Thus most techniques are studied on only one data set. Another criticism that could be levied against previous evaluations of multi-variate visualizations is that the task doesn't require the presence of multiple variables. At the same time, the taxonomy of tasks that users may perform visually is extensive. We designed a task, trend localization, that required comparison of multiple data values in a multi-variate visualization. We then conducted a user study with this task, evaluating five multivariate visualization techniques from the literature (Brush Strokes, Data-Driven Spots, Oriented Slivers, Color Blending, Dimensional Stacking) and juxtaposed grayscale maps. We report the results and discuss the implications for both the techniques and the task.
Research in the field of complex fluids such as polymer solutions, particulate suspensions and foams studies how the flow of fluids with different material parameters changes as a result of various constraints. Surface Evolver, the standard solver software used to generate foam simulations, provides large, complex, time-dependent data sets with hundreds or thousands of individual bubbles and thousands of time steps. However this software has limited visualization capabilities, and no foam specific visualization software exists. We describe the foam research application area where, we believe, visualization has an important role to play. We present a novel application that provides various techniques for visualization, exploration and analysis of time-dependent 2D foam simulation data. We show new features in foam simulation data and new insights into foam behavior discovered using our application.
A forecasting system for the Great Lakes in which the data generated by a three-dimensional numerical model is visualized by a 3-D/stereoscopic display module is discussed. The module consists of a control panel and a display window with the capability of interactively rendering the results. The event scheduling for scenario testing to steer the 3-D numerical model is achieved by a similar panel. These panels set up the simulation and control the data flow between the graphics workstation and supercomputer. Rendering methods, stereo imagery, and animation are incorporated to display the results. Interaction between the user, the workstation, and the supercomputer allows steering of the simulation and tracing of the simulation output. Distributed software for postprocessing and volume rendering are used to enhance the representation.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
It is shown that by a simple (one-way) mapping from quaternions to complex numbers, the problem of generating a four-dimensional Mandelbrot set by iteration of a quadratic function in quaternions can be reduced to iteration of the same function in the complex domain, and thus, the function values in 4-D can be obtained by a simple table lookup. The computations are cut down by an order. Simple ways of displaying the fractal without shading and ways of fast ray tracing such a fractal using the table so generated are discussed. Further speedup in ray tracing can be achieved by estimates of a distance of a point from the Mandelbrot set. Animation is a key factor in visualizing 4-D objects. Three types of animation are attempted: translation in 4-D, rotation in 4-D, and fly-through in 3-D.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Algorithms for rendering complex and shaded animation sequences are described. The target display device for these image rendering algorithms is a multichannel display based on the superposing technique realized in hardware. An animation sequence is displayed by superposing a dynamic foreground on a static background. The static background can be a very complex scene, and the dynamic foreground can be an image with a simple to medium complexity. These two algorithms were developed based on raytracing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A method is presented for juxtaposing 4D space-time vector fields, of which one contains a source variable and the other the response field. Thresholding, ellipsoid fitting, and vortex line generation are used to reduce the amount of information and help analyze the relationship between two 3D vector variables evolving in time. The technique helps to highlight the topological relationship between the two in an effort to understand the causal connection. These concepts are applied to on-going research in evolving fluid dynamics problems.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
As ecological awareness increases there has been a shift towards more integrated forest management. Accurate modeling of future states of forested landscapes will allow better planning for safeguarding our forest resource for future generations. We present an initial exploration into providing visual access to information generated by SELES (Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator). We explore the application of our visual access distortion technique to a block of temporal data created from a sequence of landscape event based information. This type of access extends the possibilities of visual exploration for temporal and spatial interrelations in a data set.

The paper discusses a unique way to visualize height field data-the use of solid fabricated parts with a photomapped texture to display scalar information. In this process, the data in a height field are turned into a 3D solid representation through solid freeform fabrication techniques, in this case laminated object manufacturing. Next, that object is used as a 3D "photographic plate" to allow a texture image representing scalar data to be permanently mapped onto it. The paper discusses this process and how it can be used in different visualization situations.
Color is widely and reliably used to display the value of a single scalar variable. It is more rarely, and far less reliably, used to display multivariate data. Dynamic control over the parameters of the color mapping results in a more effective environment for the exploration of multivariate spatial distributions. The paper describes an empirical study comparing the effectiveness of static versus dynamic representations for the exploration of qualitative aspects of bivariate distributions. In this experiment, subjects made judgments about the correspondence of the shape, location, and magnitude of two patterns under conditions with varying amounts of random noise. Subjects made significantly more correct judgements (p&lt;0.001) about feature shape and relative positions using the dynamic representation, on average forty-five percent more. The differences between static and dynamic representations were greater in the presence of noise.
This paper presents a tool for the visual exploration of DNA sequences represented as H-curves. Although very long sequences can be plotted using H-curves, micro-features are lost as sequences get longer. We present a new three-dimensional distortion algorithm to allow the magnification of a sub-segment of an H-curve while preserving a global view of the curve. This is particularly appropriate for H-curves as they provide useful visual information at several resolutions. Our approach also extends the current possibilities of detail-in-context viewing in 3D. It provides a non-occluding, orthogonal technique that preserves uniform scaling within regions and maintains geometric continuity between regions.
We describe an aircraft design problem in high dimensional space, with D typically being 10 to 30. In some respects this is a classic optimization problem, where the goal is to find the point that minimizes an objective function while satisfying a set of constraints. However, evaluating an individual point is expensive, and the high dimensionality makes many approaches to solving the problem infeasible. The difficulty of the problem means that aircraft designers would benefit from any insights that can be provided. We discuss how simple visualizations have already proved beneficial, and then describe how visualization might be of further help in the future.
A rigorous mathematical review of ray tracing is presented. The concept of a generic voxel decoder acting on flexible voxel formats is introduced. The necessity of interpolating opacity weighted colors is proved, using a new definition of the blending process in terms of functional integrals. The continuum limit of the discrete opacity accumulation formula is presented, and its convexity properties are investigated. The issues pertaining to interpolation/classification order are discussed. The lighting equation is expressed in terms of opacity weighted colors. The multi-resolution (along the ray) correction of the opacity-weighted color is derived. The mathematics of filtering on the image plane are studied, and an upper limit of the local pixel size on the image plane is obtained. Interpolation of pixel values on the image plane is shown to be in-equivalent to blending of interpolated samples.
Richly expressive information visualizations are difficult to design and rarely found. Few software tools can generate multidimensional visualizations at all, let alone incorporate artistic detail. Although, it is a great efficiency to reuse these visualizations with new data, the associated artistic detail is rarely reusable. The Relational Visualization Notation is a new technique and toolkit for specifying highly expressive graphical representations of data without traditional programming. We seek to discover the accessible power of this notation, both its graphical expressiveness and its ease of re-use. Towards this end we have used the system to reconstruct Minard's visualization of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. The resulting image is strikingly similar to the original, and the design is straightforward to construct. Furthermore, the design permitted by the notation can be directly reused to visualize Hitler's WWII defeat before Moscow. This experience leads us to believe that artistically expressive visualizations can be made to be reusable.
The authors present a visualization system for interactive real time animation and visualization of simulation results from a parallel Particle-in-Cell code. The system was designed and implemented for the Onyx2 Infinite Reality hardware. A number of different visual objects, such as volume rendered particle density functionals were implemented. To provide sufficient frame rates for interactive visualization, the system was designed to provide performance close to the hardware specifications both in terms of the I/O and graphics subsystems. The presented case study applies the developed system to the evolution of an instability that gives rise to a plasma surfatron, a mechanism which rapidly can accelerate particles to very high velocities and thus be of great importance in the context of electron acceleration in astrophysical shocks, in the solar corona and in particle accelerators. The produced visualizations have allowed us to identify a previously unknown saturation mechanism for the surfatron and direct research efforts into new areas of interest.
Active stereo has been used by engineers and industrial designers for several years to enhance the perception of computer generated three-dimensional images. Unfortunately, active stereo requires specialized hardware. Therefore, as ubiquitous computing and teleworking gain importance, using active stereo becomes a problem. The goal of this case study is to examine the concept of a generic library for polychromatic passive stereo to make stereo vision available everywhere.
This paper describes the work of a team of researchers in computer graphics, geometric computing, and civil engineering to produce a visualization of the September 2001 attack on the Pentagon. The immediate motivation for the project was to understand the behavior of the building under the impact. The longer term motivation was to establish a path for producing high-quality visualizations of large scale simulations. The first challenge was managing the enormous complexity of the scene to fit within the limits of state-of-the art simulation software systems and supercomputing resources. The second challenge was to integrate the simulation results into a high-quality visualization. To meet this challenge, we implemented a custom importer that simplifies and loads the massive simulation data in a commercial animation system. The surrounding scene is modeled using image-based techniques and is also imported in the animation system where the visualization is produced. A specific issue for us was to federate the simulation and the animation systems, both commercial systems not under our control and following internally different conceptualizations of geometry and animation. This had to be done such that scalability was achieved. The reusable link created between the two systems allows communicating the results to non-specialists and the public at large, as well as facilitating communication in teams with members having diverse technical backgrounds.
Feature detection in flow fields is a well-researched area, but practical application is often difficult due to the numerical complexity of the algorithms preventing interactive use and due to noise in experimental or high-resolution simulation data sets. We present an integrated system that provides interactive denoising, vortex detection, and visualisation of vector data on Cartesian grids. All three major phases are implemented in such a way that the system runs completely on a modern GPU once the vector field is downloaded into graphics memory. The application aspect of our paper is twofold. First, we show how recently presented, prototypical GPU-based algorithms for filtering, numerical computation, and volume rendering can be combined into one productive system by handling all idiosyncrasies of a chosen graphics card. Second, we demonstrate that the significant speedup achieved compared to an optimized software implementation now allows interactive exploration of characteristic structures in turbulent flow fields.
The genus of a knot or link can be defined via Seifert surfaces. A Seifert surface of a knot or link is an oriented surface whose boundary coincides with that, knot or link. Schematic images of these surfaces are shown in every text book on knot theory, but from these it is hard to understand their shape and structure. In this paper the visualization of such surfaces is discussed. A method is presented to produce different styles of surfaces for knots and links, starting from the so-called braid representation. Also, it is shown how closed oriented surfaces can be generated in which the knot is embedded, such that the knot subdivides the surface into two parts. These closed surfaces provide a direct visualization of the genus of a knot.
We present the first scalable algorithm that supports the composition of successive rectilinear deformations. Earlier systems that provided stretch and squish navigation could only handle small datasets. More recent work featuring rubber sheet navigation for large datasets has focused on rendering and on application-specific issues. However, no algorithm has yet been presented for carrying out such navigation methods; our paper addresses this problem. For maximum flexibility with large datasets, a stretch and squish navigation algorithm should allow for millions of potentially deformable regions. However, typical usage only changes the extents of a small subset k of these n regions at a time. The challenge is to avoid computations that are linear in n, because a single deformation can affect the absolute screen-space location of every deformable region. We provide an O(klogn) algorithm that supports any application that can lay out a dataset on a generic grid, and show an implementation that allows navigation of trees and gene sequences with millions of items in sub-millisecond time
We present GyVe, an interactive visualization tool for understanding structure in sparse three-dimensional (3D) point data. The scientific goal driving the tool's development is to determine the presence of filaments and voids as defined by inferred 3D galaxy positions within the horologium-reticulum supercluster (HRS). GyVe provides visualization techniques tailored to examine structures defined by the intercluster galaxies. Specific techniques include: interactive user control to move between a global overview and local viewpoints, labelled axes and curved drop lines to indicate positions in the astronomical RA-DEC-cz coordinate system, torsional rocking and stereo to enhance 3D perception, and geometrically distinct glyphs to show potential correlation between intercluster galaxies and known clusters. We discuss the rationale for each design decision and review the success of the techniques in accomplishing the scientific goals. In practice, GyVe has been useful for gaining intuition about structures that were difficult to perceive with 2D projection techniques alone. For example, during their initial session with GyVe, our collaborators quickly confirmed scientific conclusions regarding the large-scale structure of the HRS previously obtained over months of study with 2D projections and statistical techniques. Further use of GyVe revealed the spherical shape of voids and showed that a presumed filament was actually two disconnected structures
We develop a new algorithm for isosurface extraction and view-dependent filtering from large time-varying fields, by using a novel persistent time-octree (PTOT) indexing structure. Previously, the persistent octree (POT) was proposed to perform isosurface extraction and view-dependent filtering, which combines the advantages of the interval tree (for optimal searches of active cells) and of the branch-on-need octree (BONO, for view-dependent filtering), but it only works for steady-state(i.e., single time step) data. For time-varying fields, a 4D version of POT, 4D-POT, was proposed for 4D isocontour slicing, where slicing on the time domain gives all active cells in the queried timestep and isovalue. However, such slicing is not output sensitive and thus the searching is sub-optimal. Moreover, it was not known how to support view-dependent filtering in addition to time-domain slicing.In this paper, we develop a novel persistent time-octree (PTOT) indexing structure, which has the advantages of POT and performs 4D isocontour slicing on the time domain with an output-sensitive and optimal searching. In addition, when we query the same iso value q over m consecutive time steps, there is no additional searching overhead (except for reporting the additional active cells) compared to querying just the first time step. Such searching performance for finding active cells is asymptotically optimal, with asymptotically optimal space and preprocessing time as well. Moreover, our PTOT supports view-dependent filtering in addition to time-domain slicing. We propose a simple and effective out-of-core scheme, where we integrate our PTOT with implicit occluders, batched occlusion queries and batched CUDA computing tasks, so that we can greatly reduce the I/O cost as well as increase the amount of data being concurrently computed in GPU.This results in an efficient algorithm for isosurface extraction with view-dependent filtering utilizing a state-of-the-art programmable GPU for time-varying fields larger than main memory. Our experiments on datasets as large as 192 GB (with 4 GB per time step) having no more than 870 MB of memory footprint in both preprocessing and run-time phases demonstrate the efficacy of our new technique.
Volumetric datasets are often modeled using a multiresolution approach based on a nested decomposition of the domain into a polyhedral mesh. Nested tetrahedral meshes generated through the longest edge bisection rule are commonly used to decompose regular volumetric datasets since they produce highly adaptive crack-free representations. Efficient representations for such models have been achieved by clustering the set of tetrahedra sharing a common longest edge into a structure called a diamond. The alignment and orientation of the longest edge can be used to implicitly determine the geometry of a diamond and its relations to the other diamonds within the hierarchy. We introduce the supercube as a high-level primitive within such meshes that encompasses all unique types of diamonds. A supercube is a coherent set of edges corresponding to three consecutive levels of subdivision. Diamonds are uniquely characterized by the longest edge of the tetrahedra forming them and are clustered in supercubes through the association of the longest edge of a diamond with a unique edge in a supercube. Supercubes are thus a compact and highly efficient means of associating information with a subset of the vertices, edges and tetrahedra of the meshes generated through longest edge bisection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the supercube representation when encoding multiresolution diamond hierarchies built on a subset of the points of a regular grid. We also show how supercubes can be used to efficiently extract meshes from diamond hierarchies and to reduce the storage requirements of such variable-resolution meshes.
Medical illustration has demonstrated its effectiveness to depict salient anatomical features while hiding the irrelevant details. Current solutions are ineffective for visualizing fibrous structures such as muscle, because typical datasets (CT or MRI) do not contain directional details. In this paper, we introduce a new muscle illustration approach that leverages diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and example-based texture synthesis techniques. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we reformulate it into a scalar field and an auxiliary guidance vector field to represent the structure and orientation of a muscle bundle. A muscle mask derived from the input diffusion tensor image is used to classify the muscle structure. The guidance vector field is further refined to remove noise and clarify structure. To simulate the internal appearance of the muscle, we propose a new two-dimensional example based solid texture synthesis algorithm that builds a solid texture constrained by the guidance vector field. Illustrating the constructed scalar field and solid texture efficiently highlights the global appearance of the muscle as well as the local shape and structure of the muscle fibers in an illustrative fashion. We have applied the proposed approach to five example datasets (four pig hearts and a pig leg), demonstrating plausible illustration and expressiveness.
We present a new technique for providing interpolation within cell-centered Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that achieves C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; continuity throughout the 3D domain. Our technique improves on earlier work in that it does not require that adjacent patches differ by at most one refinement level. Our approach takes the dual of each mesh patch and generates "stitching cells" on the fly to fill the gaps between dual meshes. We demonstrate applications of our technique with data from Enzo, an AMR cosmological structure formation simulation code. We show ray-cast visualizations that include contributions from particle data (dark matter and stars, also output by Enzo) and gridded hydrodynamic data. We also show results from isosurface studies, including surfaces in regions where adjacent patches differ by more than one refinement level.
The need for direct volume visualization display devices is discussed, as well as some specifics of the Texas Instruments OmniView technology. The topics discussed include the concept of operations, the rotating surface, the display volume, the transport theory model, the image quality in the display, and applications. The outlook for future volumetric displays is addressed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
To visualize the volume data acquired from computation or sampling, it is necessary to estimate normals at the points corresponding to object surfaces. Volume data does not holds the geometric information for the surface comprising points, so it is necessary to calculate normals using local information at each point. The existing normal estimation methods have some problems of estimating incorrect normals at discontinuous, aliased or noisy points. Yagel et al. (1992) solved some of these problems using their context-sensitive method. However, this method requires too much processing time and it loses some information on detailed parts of the object surfaces. This paper proposes the surface-characteristic-sensitive normal estimation method which applies different operators according to characteristics of each surface for the normal calculation. This method has the same advantages of the context-sensitive method, and also some other advantages such as less processing time and the reduction of the information loss on detailed parts.

We attack the problem of image based rendering with occlusions and general camera motions by using distorted multiperspective images; such images provide multiple viewpoint photometry similar to the paintings of cubist artists. We take scene geometry, in contrast, to be embodied in mappings of viewing rays from their original 3D intercepts into the warped multiperspective image space. This approach allows us to render approximations of scenes with occlusions using time dense and spatially sparse sequences of camera rays, which is a significant improvement over the storage requirements of an equivalent animation sequence. Additional data compression can be achieved using sparse time keyframes as well. Interpolating the paths of sparse time key rays correctly in image space requires singular interpolation functions with spatial discontinuities. While there are many technical questions yet to be resolved, the employment of these singular interpolation functions in the multiperspective image space appears to be of potential interest for generating general viewpoint scene renderings with minimal data storage.
The development of a high speed multi-frequency continuous scan sonar at Sonar Research &amp; Development Ltd has resulted in the acquisition of extremely accurate, high resolution bathymetric data. This rich underwater data provides new challenges and possibilities within the field of seabed visualization. This paper introduces the reader to seabed visualization by describing two example case studies which use the Seabed Visualization System developed at SRD. Both case studies, harbour wall and shipwreck visualization, are implemented using real survey data. The high resolution of the data obtained means slight changes in the seabed topography are easily distinguishable. Annual survey inspections in both case studies enable comparisons to be made between the data sets making the visualization system an important tool for management and planning.

In this case study we discuss an interactive feature tracking system and its use for the analysis of chromatin decondensation. Features are described as points in a multidimensional attribute space. Distances between points are used as a measure for feature correspondence. Users can interactively experiment with the correspondence measure in order to gain insight in chromatin movement. In addition, by defining time as an attribute, tracking problems related to noisy confocal data can be circumvented.
The paper addresses visualization issues of the Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission (C.A. Beichman et al., 1999). The goal of this mission is to search for chemical signatures of life in distant solar systems using five satellites flying in formation to simulate a large telescope. To design and visually verify such a delicate mission, one has to analyze and interact with many different 3D spacecraft trajectories, which is often difficult in 2D. We employ a novel trajectory design approach using invariant manifold theory, which is best understood and utilized in an immersive setting. The visualization also addresses multi-scale issues related to the vast differences in distance, velocity, and time at different phases of the mission. Additionally, the parameterization and coordinate frames used for numerical simulations may not be suitable for direct visualization. Relative motion presents a more serious problem where the patterns of the trajectories can only be viewed in particular rotating frames. Some of these problems are greatly relieved by using interactive, animated stereo 3D visualization in a semi-immersive environment such as a Responsive Workbench. Others were solved using standard techniques such as a stratify approach with multiple windows to address the multiscale issues, re-parameterizations of trajectories and associated 2D manifolds and relative motion of the camera to "evoke" the desired patterns.
We present an innovative modeling and rendering primitive, called the O-buffer, for sample-based graphics, such as images, volumes and points. The 2D or 3D O-buffer is in essence a conventional image or a volume, respectively, except that samples are not restricted to a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The offset is typically quantized for compact representation and efficient rendering. The O-buffer emancipates pixels and voxels from the regular grids and can greatly improve the modeling power of images and volumes. It is a semi-regular structure which lends itself to efficient construction and rendering. Image quality can be improved by storing more spatial information with samples and by avoiding multiple resamplings and delaying reconstruction to the final rendering stage. Using O-buffers, more accurate multi-resolution representations can be developed for images and volumes. It can also be exploited to represent and render unstructured primitives, such as points, particles, curvilinear or irregular volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a uniform representation for a variety of graphics primitives and supports mixing them in the same scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the O-buffer with hierarchical O-buffers, layered depth O-buffers, and hybrid volume rendering with O-buffers.
Simulation of rigid body dynamics has been a field of active research for quite some time. However, the presentation of simulation results has received far less attention so far. We present an interactive and intuitive 3D visualization framework for rigid body simulation data. We introduce various glyphs representing vector attributes such as force and velocity as well as angular attributes including angular velocity and torque. We have integrated our visualization method into an application developed at one of the leading companies in automotive engine design and simulation. We apply our principles to visualization of chain and belt driven timing drives in engines.
This poster abstract presents a scalable information visualization system for mobile devices and desktop systems. It is designed to support the operation and the workflow of wastewater systems. The regarded information data includes general information about buildings and units, process data, occupational safety regulations, work directions and first aid instructions in case of an accident. Technically, the presented framework combines visualization with agent technology in order to automatically scale various visualization types to fit on different platforms like PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) or Tablet PCs. The implementation is based on but not limited to SQL, JSP, HTML and VRML.
Virtual prototyping is increasingly replacing real mock-ups and experiments in industrial product development. Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on finite element analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts, which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understating these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.
We present a novel method to encode four data channels in a volumetric data set, and render it at interactive frame rates with maximum intensity projection (MIP) using textured polygons. The first three channels are stored in the volume texture’s red, green, and blue components. The fourth channel is stored in the alpha channel. To achieve real-time rendering speed we are using a pixel shader.
We present a system for three-dimensional visualization of complex liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) data. Every LCMS data point has three attributes: time, mass, and intensity. Instead of the traditional visualization of two-dimensional subsets of the data, we visualize it as a height field or terrain in 3D. Unlike traditional terrains, LCMS data has non-linear sampling and consists mainly of tall needle-like features. We adapt the level-of-detail techniques of geometry clipmaps for hardware-accelerated rendering of LCMS data. The data is cached in video memory as a set of nested rectilinear grids centered about the view frustum. We introduce a simple compression scheme and dynamically stream data from the CPU to the GPU as the viewpoint moves. Our system allows interactive investigation of complex LCMS data with close to one billion data points at up to 130 frames per second, depending on the view conditions.
We present an efficient point-based isosurface exploration system with high quality rendering. Our system incorporates two point-based isosurface extraction and visualization methods: edge splatting and the edge kernel method. In a volume, two neighboring voxels define an edge. The intersection points between the active edges and the isosurface are used for exact isosurface representation. The point generation is incorporated in the GPU-based hardware-accelerated rendering, thus avoiding any overhead when changing the isovalue in the exploration. We call this method edge splatting. In order to generate high quality isosurface rendering regardless of the volume resolution and the view, we introduce an edge kernel method. The edge kernel upsamples the isosurface by subdividing every active cell of the volume data. Enough sample points are generated to preserve the exact shape of the isosurface defined by the trilinear interpolation of the volume data. By employing these two methods, we can achieve interactive isosurface exploration with high quality rendering
Physics-based flow visualization techniques seek to mimic laboratory flow visualization methods with virtual analogues. In this work we describe the rendering of a virtual rheoscopic fluid to produce images with results strikingly similar to laboratory experiments with real-world rheoscopic fluids using products such as Kalliroscope. These fluid additives consist of microscopic, anisotropic particles which, when suspended in the flow, align with both the flow velocity and the local shear to produce high-quality depictions of complex flow structures. Our virtual rheoscopic fluid is produced by defining a closed-form formula for the orientation of shear layers in the flow and using this orientation to volume render the flow as a material with anisotropic reflectance and transparency. Examples are presented for natural convection, thermocapillary convection, and Taylor-Couette flow simulations. The latter agree well with photographs of experimental results of Taylor-Couette flows from the literature.
A stand-alone visualization application has been developed by a multi-disciplinary, collaborative team with the sole purpose of creating an interactive exploration environment allowing turbulent flow researchers to experiment and validate hypotheses using visualization. This system has specific optimizations made in data management, caching computations, and visualization allowing for the interactive exploration of datasets on the order of 1TB in size. Using this application, the user (co-author Calo) is able to interactively visualize and analyze all regions of a transitional flow volume, including the laminar, transitional and fully turbulent regions. The underlying goal of the visualizations produced from these transitional flow simulations is to localize turbulent spots in the laminar region of the boundary layer, determine under which conditions they form, and follow their evolution. The initiation of turbulent spots, which ultimately lead to full turbulence, was located via a proposed feature detection condition and verified by experimental results. The conditions under which these turbulent spots form and coalesce are validated and presented.
Simulation and computation in chemistry studies have been improved as computational power has increased over decades. Many types of chemistry simulation results are available, from atomic level bonding to volumetric representations of electron density. However, tools for the visualization of the results from quantum chemistry computations are still limited to showing atomic bonds and isosurfaces or isocontours corresponding to certain isovalues. In this work, we study the volumetric representations of the results from quantum chemistry computations, and evaluate and visualize the representations directly on the GPU without resampling the result in grid structures. Our visualization tool handles the direct evaluation of the approximated wavefunctions described as a combination of Gaussian-like primitive basis functions. For visualizations, we use a slice based volume rendering technique with a 2D transfer function, volume clipping, and illustrative rendering in order to reveal and enhance the quantum chemistry structure. Since there is no need of resampling the volume from the functional representations, two issues, data transfer and resampling resolution, can be ignored, therefore, it is possible to interactively explore large amount of different information in the computation results.
FIELDVIEW, a visual analysis tool designed to facilitate the interactive investigation of fluid mechanics data sets by providing an easy-to-use interface to the flow field data, is presented. Operating on NASA Plot three-dimensional format data, FIELDVIEW computes scalar and vector flow quantities and displays them using a variety of representations, including animation. An interactive viewing interface allows free motion around the data under study to allow the researcher to locate and study the interesting flow features of three-dimensional fluid dynamic data.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The user of a parallel computer system would like to know the performance of a program in terms of how optimally it uses the system resources. This task is increasingly performed by program performance visualization. The limitations of conventional performance data analysis techniques necessitate better visual analysis methods that are scalable with the problem and system sizes and extensible. They should represent some physical and logical structure of the parallel system and program. The analysis techniques presented here have been motivated by the use of signal and (two- and three-dimensional) image processing techniques being applied in some areas of scientific visualization. Results of applying selected techniques are shown. These techniques and tools have advantages and disadvantages when applied in this area.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A supercomputing-visualization facility for science and engineering applications was used for processing and visualizing supercomputer-generated data. This facility includes a vector-processing supercomputer, a graphics workstation, a general purpose workstation, a high-resolution color printer, a scanner, a film recorder, a video tape recorder, and a video laser disc recorder. The facility is using a network system to connect computers, workstations, and graphical input/output devices. The supercomputer generates time-dependent multivariate data using a global climate simulation model. Visualization software systems are used for visualizing these model-produced data. Visualization techniques including: iso-contouring, iso-surface generation, vectors and streamlines generation are used.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The features of greatest interest in ocean modeling in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Stream are the fronts and eddies. Resolving, modeling, and tracking these eddies over time is of great importance for climatological studies and economic advancement. In this paper we present a novel technique for automatically locating, contouring, and tracking oceanic features such as eddies and fronts. The models and resultant visualizations exhibit excellent correlation with observed data.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In the field of computer applications to archaeology, data visualization is one of the most recent and promising activity. The visual reconstruction obtained from partially or totally ruined data is a problem that archaeologists often face with during their work. The case we present here is the simulated reconstruction of a great Egyptian tomb of the VII century B.C. excavated in the rocky cliff of the desert. The visualization method is fundamental for testing the hypotheses made and as a strategic solution in the concrete reconstruction. The hundreds of magnificent decorated blocks saved by museums will never be positioned again on its walls. Moreover, in front of the stress and pollution caused to ancient monuments by a massive tourism, the ever-growing improving of visualization and animation techniques, like the ones presented in this paper, makes of considerable interest the modeling and the exploration inside the virtual monuments through realistic tours.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;

We describe a toolkit for the design and visualization of flexible artificial heart valves. The toolkit consists of interlinked modules with a visual programming interface. The user of the toolkit can set the initial geometry and material properties of the valve leaflet, solve for the flexing of the leaflet and the flow of blood around it, and display the results using the visualization capabilities of the toolkit. The interactive nature of our environment is highlighted by the fact that changes in leaflet properties are immediately reflected in the flow field and response of the leaflet. Hence the user may, in a single session, investigate a broad range of designs, each one of which provides important information about the blood flow and motion of the valve during the cardiac cycle.
For most of the time, we enjoy and appreciate music performances as they are. Once we try to understand the performance not in subjective terms but in an objective way and share it with other people, visualizing the performance parameters is indispensable. In this paper, a figure for visualizing performance expressions is described. This figure helps people understand the cause and position of the performance expression as it has expressive cues, which coincide with the cognitive meaning of musical performance, and not by using only MIDI parameter values. The differences we hear between performances are clarified by visualized figures.
In this paper, we describe a set of 3D and 4D visualization tools and techniques for CORIE, a complex environmental observation and forecasting system (EOFS) for the Columbia River. The Columbia River, a complex and highly variable estuary, is the target of numerous cross-disciplinary ecosystem research projects and is at the heart of multiple sustainable development issues with long reaching implications for the Pacific Northwest. However, there has been until recently no comprehensive and objective system available for modeling this environment, and as a consequence, researchers and agencies have had inadequate tools for evaluating the effects of natural resource management decisions. CORIE was designed to address this gap and is a major step towards the vision of a scalable, multi-use, real-time EOFS. Although CORIE already had a rich set of visualization tools, most of them produced 2D visualizations and did not allow for interactive visualization. Our work adds advanced interactive 3D tools to CORIE, which can be used for further inspection of the simulated and measured data.
Researchers in computational condensed matter physics deal with complex data sets consisting of time varying 3D tensor, vector, and scalar quantities. Particularly, in the research of topological defects in nematic liquid crystals (LC) displaying the results of the computer simulation of molecular dynamics presents a challenge. Combining existing immersive and interactive visualization methods we developed new methods that attempt to provide a clear, efficient, and intuitive way to visualize and explore LC data. In addition, the visualization of the data has presented us with a novel method of obtaining the locations of the topological defects present in a liquid crystal system.
In this article we describe stress nets, a technique for exploring 2D tensor fields. Our method allows a user to examine simultaneously the tensors' eigenvectors (both major and minor) as well as scalar-valued tensor invariants. By avoiding noise-advection techniques, we are able to display both principal directions of the tensor field as well as the derived scalars without cluttering the display. We present a CPU-only implementation of stress nets as well as a hybrid CPU/GPU approach and discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. Stress nets have been used as part of an investigation into crack propagation. They were used to display the directions of maximum shear in a slab of material under tension as well as the magnitude of the shear forces acting on each point. Our methods allowed users to find new features in the data that were not visible on standard plots of tensor invariants. These features disagree with commonly accepted analytical crack propagation solutions and have sparked renewed investigation. Though developed for a materials mechanics problem, our method applies equally well to any 2D tensor field having unique characteristic directions.
Traditionally, sort-middle is a technique that has been difficult to attain on clusters because of the tight coupling of geometry and rasterization processes on commodity graphics hardware. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a new sort-middle approach for performing immediate-mode rendering in Chromium. The Chromium Rendering System is used extensively to drive multi-projector displays on PC clusters with inexpensive commodity graphics components. By default, Chromium uses a sort-first approach to distribute rendering work to individual nodes in a PC cluster. While this sort-first approach works effectively in retained-mode rendering, it suffers from various network bottlenecks when rendering in immediate-mode. Current techniques avoid these bottlenecks by sorting vertex data as a pre-processing step and grouping vertices into specific bounding boxes, using Chromium's bounding box extension. These steps may be expensive, especially if the dataset is dynamic. In our approach, we utilize standard programmable graphics hardware and extend standard APIs to achieve a separation in the rendering pipeline. The pre-processing of vertex data or the grouping of vertices into bounding boxes are not required. Additionally, the amount of OpenGL state commands transmitted through the network are reduced. Our results indicate that the approach can attain twice the frame rates as compared to Chromium's sort-first approach when rendering in immediate-mode.
Topology has been an important tool for analyzing scalar data and flow fields in visualization. In this work, we analyze the topology of multivariate image and volume data sets with discontinuities in order to create an efficient, raster-based representation we call IStar. Specifically, the topology information is used to create a dual structure that contains nodes and connectivity information for every segmentable region in the original data set. This graph structure, along with a sampled representation of the segmented data set, is embedded into a standard raster image which can then be substantially downsampled and compressed. During rendering, the raster image is upsampled and the dual graph is used to reconstruct the original function. Unlike traditional raster approaches, our representation can preserve sharp discontinuities at any level of magnification, much like scalable vector graphics. However, because our representation is raster-based, it is well suited to the real-time rendering pipeline. We demonstrate this by reconstructing our data sets on graphics hardware at real-time rates.
Acoustic quality in room acoustics is measured by well defined quantities, like definition, which can be derived from simulated impulse response filters or measured values. These take into account the intensity and phase shift of multiple reflections due to a wave front emanating from a sound source. Definition (D&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and clarity (C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for example correspond to the fraction of the energy received in total to the energy received in the first 50 ms at a certain listener position. Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure. For the visualization of room acoustics, however, this information is very useful since it allows to discover regions with high contribution and provides insight into the influence of all reflecting surfaces to the quality measure. We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions. This data is used to compute importance values for the geometry taking a certain acoustic metric into account. To get a visual insight into the directional aspect, we map the importance to the reflecting surfaces of the geometry. This visualization indicates which parts of the surfaces need to be changed to enhance the chosen acoustic quality measure. We apply our method to the acoustic improvement of a lecture hall by means of enhancing the overall speech comprehensibility (clarity) and evaluate the results using glyphs to visualize the clarity (C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values at listener positions throughout the room.
A survey of 2D and 3D flow visualization techniques is provided. The approach is based on applying volume rendering to flow-visualization data. Linear interpolation and B-spline approximation are used, and several views are given for both. Suggestions for efficient volume rendering are provided.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Different standard rendering methods applied to 4-D medical ultrasound data are discussed. In particular, maximum value projection, sum of values projection, transparent gray level gradient shading, and surface shading have been tested. Due to the fact that ultrasound data suffer from a low signal to noise ratio, image processing and image analysis are used to enhance and classify the volumetric data set.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The author explores some of the primary problems that face designers of hardware and software for visualization who are attempting to create tools that will be used and widely accepted. He describes possible solutions to some of these challenges that have been incorporated into Fieldview, a commercial tool for increasing engineering productivity in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A framework for the generation of atlases of the human body based on the linkage of volume data to a knowledge base is presented. The model has a two layer structure. The lower level is a volume model with a set of semantic attributes belonging to each voxel. Its spatial representation is derived from data sets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography. The semantic attributes are assigned by an anatomist using a volume editor. The upper level is a set of relations between these attributes which are also specified by the expert. Interactive visualization tools, such as multiple surface display, transparent rendering, and cutting, are provided. It is shown that the combination of this object-oriented data structure with advanced volume visualization tools provides the look and feel of a real dissection.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Addresses the needs and requirements of integrating visualization and geographic information system technologies. There are three levels of integration methods: rudimentary, operational and functional. The rudimentary approach uses the minimum amount of data sharing and exchange between these two technologies. The operational level attempts to provide consistency of the data while removing redundancies between the two technologies. The functional form attempts to provide transparent communication between these respective software environments. At this level, the user only needs to request information and the integrated system retrieves or generates the information depending upon the request. This paper examines the role and impact of these three levels of integration. Stepping further into the future, the paper also questions the long-term survival of these separate disciplines.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper describes a system, GASP, that facilitates the visualization of geometric algorithms. The user need not have any knowledge of computer graphics in order to quickly generate a visualization. The system is also intended to facilitate the task of implementing and debugging geometric algorithms. The viewer is provided with a comfortable user interface enhancing the exploration of an algorithm's functionality. We describe the underlying concepts of the system as well as a variety of examples which illustrate its use.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We discuss a visualization system for the comparison of simulated and measured water quality. The system extends SCIRT (Site Characterization Interactive Research Toolkit), an interactive system originally developed at the NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi State University. The ongoing study of the Chesapeake Bay presents research in 3D visualization of model-data comparisons.
This paper describes our experiences with using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) to view files in the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format using a Java-based translator from IGES to VRML and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). The paper examines the conversion problems between IGES and VRML and presents some results of the process.
The measurement, analysis and visualization of plant growth is of primary interest to plant biologists. We are developing software tools to support such investigations. There are two parts in this investigation, namely growth visualization of (i) a plant root and (ii) a plant stem. For both domains, the input data is a stream of images taken by cameras. The tools being developed make it possible to measure various time-varying quantities, such as differential growth. For both domains, the plant is modeled by using flexible templates to represent non-rigid motions.
We introduce a new approach for mapping texture on volumetric iso-surfaces and parametric surfaces. Our approach maps 2D images on surfaces while maintaining continuity and preserving the size of the mapped images on the models. Our approach is fully automatic. It eliminates the need for manual mapping of texture maps. We use the curvature of a surface at a point in order to continuously vary the scale of the mapped image. This makes our approach dependent only on local attributes of a point (position, normal and its derivatives) and independent of the global shape and topology of an object. Our method can map high resolution images on low resolution volumes, hence enhancing the visual appearance of rendered volume data. We describe a general framework useful for all surface types that have a C/sup 1/ continuous normal. We demonstrate the new method for painting volume data and for mapping cavities on volume data.
This case study describes the design and development of VISOR (Visual Integration of Simulated and Observed Results), a tool which supports the visualization and analysis of a wide variety of data relevant to aerospace engineering design. Integrating data from such disparate sources is challenging; overcoming the obstacles results in a powerful tool. The process has also been valuable in exposing requirements for the libraries of reusable software tools for visualization and data analysis being developed at NASA Ames.
Sediments in many parts of the New York and New Jersey estuary system are contaminated with toxic organic and inorganic compounds by different sources. Because of the potential environmental consequences, detailed information on the spatial distribution of sediment contaminants is essential in order to carry out routine shipping channel dredging in an environmentally responsible way, and to remediate hot spots cost-effectively and safely. Scientific visualization and scatter data modeling techniques have been successfully applied in analyzing the sparse sampling data of sediment contaminants in New York and New Jersey estuaries, the underlying spatial characteristics of which are otherwise difficult to comprehend. Continuous realizations of contaminant concentrations in the region were obtained by using a spectral domain-decomposition scattered data model and IBM Data Explorer which is a software package for scientific data visualization.
The display of iso-surfaces in medical data sets is an important visualization technique used by radiologists for the diagnosis of volumetric density data sets. The demands put by radiologists on such a display technique are interactivity, multiple stacked transparent surfaces and cutting planes that allow an interactive clipping of the surfaces. This paper presents a Java based, platform independent implementation of a very fast surface rendering algorithm which combines the advantages of explicit surface representation, splatting, and shear-warp projection to fulfill all these requirements. The algorithm is implemented within the context of J-Vision, an application for viewing and diagnosing medical images which is currently in use at various hospitals.
Visualization techniques enable scientists to interactively explore 3D data sets, segmenting and cutting them to reveal inner structure. While powerful, these techniques suffer from one serious flaw-the images they create are displayed on a flat piece of glass or paper. It is not really 3D-it can only be made to appear 3D. We describe the construction of 3D physical models from volumetric data. Using solid freeform fabrication equipment, these models are built as separate interlocking pieces that express in physical form the segmentation and cutting operations common in display-based visualization.
The simulation of breaking of waves, the formation of thin spray sheets, and the entertainment of air around the next generation of naval surface combatants is an ongoing 3-year Department of Defense (DoD) Challenge Project. The goal of this project is a validated computation capability to model the full hydrodynamics around a surface combatant including all of the processes that affect mission and performance. Visualization of these large-scale simulations is paramount to understanding the complex physics involved. These simulations produce enormous data sets with both surface and volumetric qualities. Wave breaking, spray sheets, and air entertainment can be visualized using isosurfaces of scalar data. Visualization of quantities such as the vorticity field also provides insight into the dynamics of droplet and bubble formation. This paper documents the techniques used, results obtained, and lessons learned from the visualization of the hydrodynamics of naval vessels.
Computer graphics has be successfully applied to architecture design. There is more demand to new applications. One of them, to be addressed in this work, is the code checking and visualization of the checking results.
Topological methods are often used to describe flow structures in fluid dynamics and topological flow field analysis usually relies on the invariants of the associated tensor fields. A visual impression of the local properties of tensor fields is often complex and the search of a suitable technique for achieving this is an ongoing topic in visualization. This paper introduces and assesses a method of representing the topological properties of tensor fields and their respective flow patterns with the use of colors. First, a tensor norm is introduced, which preserves the properties of the tensor and assigns the tensor invariants to values of the RGB color space. Secondly, the RGB colors of the tensor invariants are transferred to corresponding hue values as an alternative color representation. The vectorial tensor invariants field is reduced to a scalar hue field and visualization of iso-surfaces of this hue value field allows us to identify locations with equivalent flow topology. Additionally highlighting by the maximum of the eigenvalue difference field reflects the magnitude of the structural change of the flow. The method is applied on a vortex breakdown flow structure inside a cylinder with a rotating lid
A method for the semi-automatic detection and visualization of defects in models of nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) is introduced; this method is suitable for unstructured models, a previously unsolved problem. The detected defects - also known as disclinations - are regions were the alignment of the liquid crystal rapidly changes over space; these defects play a large role in the physical behavior of the NLC substrate. Defect detection is based upon a measure of total angular change of crystal orientation (the director) over a node neighborhood via the use of a nearest neighbor path. Visualizations based upon the detection algorithm clearly identify complete defect regions as opposed to incomplete visual descriptions provided by cutting-plane and isosurface approaches. The introduced techniques are currently in use by scientists studying the dynamics of defect change
Visualization of general relativity illustrates aspects of Einstein's insights into the curved nature of space and time to the expert as well as the layperson. One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein's theory was developed by Kurt Godel in 1949. The Godel universe is a valid solution of Einstein's field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an optical horizon beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Godel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Godel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects of general relativity faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Godel's spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Godel's universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media. Therefore, other areas of research can benefit from these generic improvements.
One way to provide global illumination for the scientist who performs an interactive sweep through a 3D scalar dataset is to pre-compute global illumination, resample the radiance onto a 3D grid, then use it as a 3D texture. The basic approach of repeatedly extracting isosurfaces, illuminating them, and then building a 3D illumination grid suffers from the non-uniform sampling that arises from coupling the sampling of radiance with the sampling of isosurfaces. We demonstrate how the illumination step can be decoupled from the isosurface extraction step by illuminating the entire 3D scalar function as a 3-manifold in 4-dimensional space. By reformulating light transport in a higher dimension, one can sample a 3D volume without requiring the radiance samples to aggregate along individual isosurfaces in the pre-computed illumination grid.
We present a quasi interpolation framework that attains the optimal approximation-order of Voronoi splines for reconstruction of volumetric data sampled on general lattices. The quasi interpolation framework of Voronoi splines provides an unbiased reconstruction method across various lattices. Therefore this framework allows us to analyze and contrast the sampling-theoretic performance of general lattices, using signal reconstruction, in an unbiased manner. Our quasi interpolation methodology is implemented as an efficient FIR filter that can be applied online or as a preprocessing step. We present visual and numerical experiments that demonstrate the improved accuracy of reconstruction across lattices, using the quasi interpolation framework.
Overlaid reference elements need to be sufficiently visible to effectively relate to the underlying information, but not so obtrusive that they clutter the presentation. We seek to create guidelines for presenting such structures through experimental studies to define boundary conditions for visual intrusiveness. We base our work on the practice of designers, who use transparency to integrate overlaid grids with their underlying imagery. Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures.
Reconstruction of 3D scenes using data from an acoustic imaging sonar is addressed. The acoustic lens is described, and issues concerning underwater 3D scene reconstruction from the lens data are examined. Two methods for visualizing objects in an acoustic snapshot of the ocean are discussed: mathematical morphology and a synthesis of 3D digital imaging with volume rendering.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Current topographical mapping methods and problems associated with mapping are reviewed, and one approach for improving the spatial resolution of scalp recorded EEGs is detailed. In particular, techniques for interpolating the potential distribution and estimating the surface Laplacian from multichannel data are presented and applied to human evoked potential data. Although developed for electroencephalographic data, these spline algorithms can be applied to a variety of fields where visualization of spatial information is desired.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volume warping, a technique for deforming sampled volumetric data using B-splines that is related to image warping and to the free-form deformations of T.W. Sederberg and S.R. Parry (1986) and S. Coquillart (1990), is presented. The process is accelerated to near-real-time speed, and the compromises that are made to effect such speeds are explained. This technique expands the repertoire of volumetric modeling techniques and can be applied to any form of volumetric data.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The binary space partitioning tree is a method of converting a discrete space representation to a particular continuous space representation. The conversion is accomplished using standard discrete space operators developed for edge detection, followed by a Hough transform to generate candidate hyperplanes that are used to construct the partitioning tree. The result is a segmented and compressed image represented in continuous space suitable for elementary computer vision operations and improved image transmission/storage. Examples of 256*256 medical images for which the compression is estimated to range between 1 and 0.5 b/pixel are given.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The issue of monitoring the execution of asynchronous, distributed algorithms on loosely-coupled parallel processor systems, is important for the purposes of (i) detecting inconsistencies and flaws in the algorithm, (ii) obtaining important performance parameters for the algorithm, and (iii) developing a conceptual understanding of the algorithm's behavior, for given input stimulus, through visualization. For a particular class of asynchronous distributed algorithms that may be characterized by independent and concurrent entities that execute asynchronously on multiple processors and interact with one another through explicit messages, the following reasoning applies. Information about the flow of messages and the activity of the processors may contribute significantly towards the conceptual understanding of the algorithm's behavior and the functional correctness of the implementation. The computation and subsequent display of important parameters, based upon the execution of the algorithm, is an important objective of DIVIDE. For instance, the mean and standard deviation values for the propagation delay of ATM cells between any two given Broadband-ISDN (BISDN) nodes in a simulation of BISDN network under stochastic input stimulus, as a function of time, are important clues to the degree of congestion in the Broadband-ISDN network. Although the execution of the algorithm typically generates high resolution data, often, a coarse-level visual representation of the data may be useful in facilitating the conceptual understanding of the behavior of the algorithm. DIVIDE permits a user to specify a resolution less than that of the data from the execution of the algorithm, which is then utilized to coalesce the data appropriately. Given that this process requires significant computational power, for efficiency, DIVIDE distributes the overall task of visual display into a number of user specified workstations that are configured as a loosely-coupled parallel processor. DIVIDE has been implemented on a heterogeneous network of SUN sparc 1 + , sparc 2, and 3/60 workstations and performance measurements indicate significant improvement over that of a uniprocessor-based visual display.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The set of possible orientations of a rigid three-dimensional object is a topological space with three degrees of freedom. This paper investigates the suitability of various techniques of visualizing this space. With a good technique the natural distance between orientations will be represented fairly accurately, and distortion to the "shape" of a collection of orientations induced by the change of reference orientation will be minor. The traditional Euler-angle parameterization fails on both counts. Less well-known techniques exploit the fact that there is a rotation that takes the reference orientation to a given one. The given orientation is represented as a point along the axis of this rotation. The distance of this point from the origin is determined by some scaling function of the magnitude of that rotation. Free natural scaling functions are studied. None is perfect, but several are satisfactory.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present the visualization and modeling techniques used in a case study to build feature-based computational models from geophysical data. Visualization was used to inspect the quality of the interpretation of the geophysical data. We describe the geophysical data graphical representation used to support rapid rendering and to enhance the perception differences between the interpretation of the data and the data itself. In addition, we present the modeling techniques used to convert the geophysical data into a feature-based computational model suitable for use by a numerical simulation package.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The paper provides a review of the field of multidimensional data visualisation and discusses some promising methodologies. It considers some crucial problems and directions. The emphasis is more on concepts and foundations rather than ad hoc methods. Visualization is considered as a collection of transformations from problem domains to a perceptual domain, usually visual. The paper discusses the extension of visualisation from the pixel to icons.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Three topics of aerodynamic research at DLR are chosen to illustrate the need for visualization. These include aircraft configuration design variations, adaptation devices and unsteady flow simulation in the transonic, the supersonic and the hypersonic speed regime call for the combined use of a geometry generator, a powerful graphic system and video technology. Projects currently under investigation are illustrated and generic case studies are presented.
Typically, feedback from analysis of three-dimensional volume image structures are presented in the visual domain. This ignores the potential for complementary analysis of feedback in the aural domain. This paper presents a system in which visualization of a volume image may be enhanced through representation of the voxel structure by a sound sequence (termed a 'sonification') in which a sequence of sound signals is generated by the mapping of voxel values to pitch, amplitude, timing and other acoustic parameters according to the design of the selected sound instrument(s). Stereo audio or spatial audio processing techniques are employed to enhance the perception of the representative sonification as emanating from the visual loci of the associated voxel.
Presents an efficient algorithm for the reconstruction of a multivariate function from multiple sets of scattered data. Given N sets of scattered data representing N distinct dependent variables that have been sampled independently over a common domain and N error tolerance values, the algorithm constructs a triangulation of the domain of the data and associates multivariate values with the vertices of the triangulation. The resulting linear interpolation of these multivariate values yields a multivariate function, called a co-triangulation, that represents all of the dependent data up to the given error tolerance. A simple iterative algorithm for the construction of a co-triangulation from any number of data sets is presented and analyzed. The main contribution of this paper lies in the description of a highly efficient framework for the realization of this approximation algorithm. While the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm certainly remains within the theoretical bounds, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve running times that depend only linearly on the number of data even for very large problems with more than two million samples. This efficient realization of the algorithm uses adapted dynamic data structures and careful caching in an integrated framework.
Recent advances in fire science and computer modeling of fires allow scientists to predict fire growth and spread through structures. In this paper we describe a variety of visualizations of simulated room fires for use by both fire protection engineers and fire suppression personnel. We also introduce the concept of fuzzy visualization, which results from the superposition of data from several separate simulations into a single visualization.

We present a novel architecture which allows rendering of a large-shared dataset at interactive rates on an inexpensive workstation. The idea is based on view-dependent rendering on a client-server network. The server stores the large dataset and manages the selection of the various levels of detail while the inexpensive clients receive a stream of update operations that generate the appropriate level of detail in an incremental fashion. These update operations are based on changes in the clients' view-parameters. Our approach dramatically reduces the amount of memory needed by each client and the entire computing system since the dataset is stored only once on the server's local memory. In addition, it decreases the load on the network as results of the incremental update contributed by view-dependent rendering.
This paper describes BM3D: a method for the analysis of motion in time dependent volume data. From a sequence of volume data sets a sequence of vector data sets representing the movement of the data is computed. A block matching technique is used for the reconstruction of data movement. The derived vector field can be used for the visualization of time dependent volume data. The method is illustrated in two applications.
With the completion of the human genome sequence, and with the proliferation of genome-related annotation data, the need for scalable and more intuitive means for analysis becomes critical, At Variagenics and Small Design Firm, we have addressed this problem with a coherent three-dimensional space in which all data can be seen in a single context. This tool aids in integrating information at vastly divergent scales while maintaining accurate spatial and size relationships. Our visualization was successful in communicating to project teams with diverse backgrounds the magnitude and biological implication of genetic variation.
We present an innovative application developed at Sandia National Laboratories for visual debugging of unstructured finite element physics codes. Our tool automatically locates anomalous regions, such as inverted elements or nodes whose variable values lie outside a prescribed range, then extracts mesh subsets around these features for detailed examination. The subsets are viewed using color coding of variable values superimposed on the mesh structure. This allows the values and their relative spatial locations within the mesh to be correlated at a glance. Both topological irregularities and hot spots within the data stand out visually, allowing the user to explore the exact numeric values of the grid at surrounding points over time. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by debugging a cell inversion in a simulation of an exploding wire.
We describe a visualization application intended for operational use in formulating business strategy in the customer service arena. The visualization capability provided in this application implicitly allows the user to better formulate the objective function for large optimization runs which act to minimize costs based on certain input parameters. Visualization is necessary because many of the inputs to the optimization runs are themselves strategic business decisions which are not pre-ordained. Both information visualization presentations and three-dimensional visualizations are included to help users better understand the cost/benefit tradeoffs of these strategic business decisions. Here, visualization explicitly provides value not possible algorithmically, as the perceived benefit of different combinations of service level does not have an a priori mathematical formulation. Thus, we take advantage of the fundamental power of visualization, bringing the user's intuition and pattern recognition skills into the solution, while simultaneously taking advantage of the strength of algorithmic approaches to quickly and accurately find an optimal solution to a well-defined problem.

We propose an interpolating refinement method for two- and three-dimensional scalar fields defined on hexahedral grids. Iterative fairing of the underlying contours (isosurfaces) provides the function values of new grid points. Our method can be considered as a nonlinear variational subdivision scheme for volumes. It can be applied locally for adaptive mesh refinement in regions of high geometric complexity. We use our scheme to increase the quality of low-resolution data sets and to reduce interpolation artifacts in texture-based volume rendering.
Advances in graphics hardware and rendering methods are shaping the future of visualization. For example, programmable graphics processors are redefining the traditional visualization cycle. In some cases it is now possible to run the computational simulation and associated visualization side-by-side on the same chip. Moreover, global illumination and non-photorealistic effects promise to deliver imagery which enables greater insight into high resolution, multivariate, and higher-dimensional data. The panelists will offer distinct viewpoints on the direction of future graphics hardware and its potential impact on visualization, and on the nature of advanced visualizationrelated tools and techniques. Presentation of these viewpoints will be followed by audience participation in the form of a question and answer period moderated by the panel organizer.
The evacuation of buildings in the event of a fire requires careful planning of ventilation and evacuation routes during early architectural design stages. Different designs are evaluated by simulating smoke propagation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Visibility plays a decisive role in finding the nearest fire exit. This paper presents real-time volume rendering of transient smoke propagation conforming to standardized visibility distances. We visualize time dependent smoke particle concentration on unstructured tetrahedral meshes using a direct volume rendering approach. Due to the linear transfer function of the optical model commonly used in fire protection engineering, accurate pre-integration of diffuse color across tetrahedra can be carried out with a single 2D texture lookup. We reduce rounding errors during frame buffer blending by applying randomized dithering if high accuracy frame buffers are unavailable on the target platform. A simple absorption-based lighting model is evaluated in a preprocessing step using the same rendering approach. Back-illuminated exit signs are commonly used to indicate the escape route. As light emitting objects are visible further than reflective objects, the transfer function in front of illuminated exit signs must be adjusted with a deferred rendering pass.
We develop the first approach Tor interactive volume visualization based on a sophisticated rendering method of shear-warp type, wavelet data encoding techniques, and a trivariate spline model, which has been introduced recently. As a first step of our algorithm, we apply standard wavelet expansions to represent and decimate the given gridded three-dimensional data. Based on this data encoding, we give a sophisticated version of the shear-warp based volume rendering method. Our new algorithm visits each voxel only once taking advantage of the particular data organization of octrees. In addition, the hierarchies of the data guide the local (re)construction of the quadratic super-spline models, which we apply as a pure visualization tool. The low total degree of the polynomial pieces allows to numerically approximate the volume rendering integral efficiently. Since the coefficients of the splines are almost immediately available from the given data, Bernstein-Bezier techniques can be fully employed in our algorithms. In this way, we demonstrate that these models can be successfully applied to full volume rendering of hierarchically organized data. Our computational results show that (even when hierarchical approximations are used) the new approach leads to almost artifact-free visualizations of high quality for complicated and noise-contaminated volume data sets, while the computational effort is considerable low, i.e. our current implementation yields 1-2 frames per second for parallel perspective rendering a 2563 volume data set (using simple opacity transfer functions) in a 5122 view-port.
Doppler radars are useful facilities for weather forecasting. The data sampled by using Doppler radars are used to measure the distributions and densities of rain drops, snow crystals, hail stones, or even insects in the atmosphere. In this paper, we propose to build up a graphics-based software system for visualizing Doppler radar data. In the system, the reflectivity data gathered by using Doppler radars are post-processed to generate virtual cloud images which reveal the densities of precipitation in the air. An optical flow based method is adopted to compute the velocities of clouds, advected by winds. Therefore, the movement of clouds is depicted. The cloud velocities are also used to interpolate reflectivities for arbitrary time steps. Therefore, the reflectivities at any time can be produced. Our system composes of three stages. At the first stage, the raw radar data are re-sampled and filtered to create a multiple resolution data structure, based on a pyramid structure. At the second stage, a numeric method is employed to compute cloud velocities in the air and to interpolate radar reflectivity data at given time steps. The radar reflectivity data and cloud velocities are displayed at the last stage. The reflectivities are rendered by using splatting methods to produce semi-transparent cloud images. Two kinds of media are created for analyzing the reflectivity data. The first kind media consists of a group of still images of clouds which displays the distribution and density of water in the air. The second type media is a short animation of cloud images to show the formation and movement of the clouds. To show the advection of clouds, the cloud velocities are displayed by using two dimensional images. In these images, the velocities are represented by arrows and superimposed on cloud images. To enhance image quality, gradients and diffusion of the radar data are computed and used in the rendering process. Therefore the cloud structures are better portrayed. In order to achieve interactive visualization, our system is also comprised with a view-dependent visualization module. The radar data at far distance are rendered in lower resolutions, while the data closer to the eye position is rendered in details.
We present a novel approach to out-of-core time-varying isosurface visualization. We attempt to interactively visualize time-varying datasets which are too large to fit into main memory using a technique which is dramatically different from existing algorithms. Inspired by video encoding techniques, we examine the data differences between time steps to extract isosurface information. We exploit span space extraction techniques to retrieve operations necessary to update isosurface geometry from neighboring time steps. Because only the changes between time steps need to be retrieved from disk, I/O bandwidth requirements are minimized. We apply temporal compression to further reduce disk access and employ a point-based previewing technique that is refined in idle interaction cycles. Our experiments on computational simulation data indicate that this method is an extremely viable solution to large time-varying isosurface visualization. Our work advances the state-of-the-art by enabling all isosurfaces to be represented by a compact set of operations
An algorithm for rendering scalar field data that reduces rendering times by as much as two orders of magnitude over traditional full resolution images is presented. Less than full-resolution sampling of the scalar field is performed using a fast ray tracing method. The sampling grid points are output as a set of screen-based Gouraud shaded polygons which are rendered in hardware by a graphics workstation. A gradient-based variable resolution algorithm that further improves rendering speed is presented. Several examples are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An approach that uses advanced computer graphics workstations and volume rendering algorithms for accurate reconstruction of volumetric microscopy data is described. It has been found that excellent reconstructions can be made from serial sections acquired using a charge-coupled device and a conventional light microscope. Both confocal and nonconfocal reconstructions are examined. The effects of differing light sources are considered 3D image processing results are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A method of visual comparison is described, that provides the scientist with a unique tool to study the qualitative relationships between three sequences of numbers or symbols. The program displays a 3D shape containing the sequence similarities and differences, which manifest themselves as simple geometric shapes and colors that a human observer can easily detect and classify. The method presents all possible correlations to the user, giving it a considerable advantage over existing sequence comparison tools that only search for a programmed subset of all possible correlations. Thus, using this technique, researchers may detect sequence similarities that other analytic methods might completely overlook. The program can also filter out undesirable or insignificant correlations. The technique is easily adapted to a wide range of applications.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this work we focus on one of the key problems of scientific visualization, the object recognition dilemma. The necessity to pre-interpret application data in order to classify object surface voxels prior to rendering has prevented many visualization methods from becoming practical. We propose the concept of vision by visualization which integrates computer vision methods into the visualization process. Based on this, we present the vision camera, a new tool allowing for interactive object recognition during volume data walkthroughs. This camera model is characterized by a flexible front-plane which, under the control of user-specified parameters and image features elastically matches to object surfaces, while shifted through a data volume. Thus, objects are interactively carved out and can be visualized by standard volume visualization methods. Implementation and application of the model are described. Our results suggest that by the integration of human and machine vision new perspectives for data exploration are opened up.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Direct analysis of spacecraft observations of stratospheric ozone yields information about the morphology of annual austral depletion. Visual correlation of ozone with other atmospheric data illustrates the diurnal dynamics of the polar vortex and contributions from the upper troposphere, including the formation and breakup of the depletion region each spring. These data require care in their presentation to minimize the introduction of visualization artifacts that are erroneously interpreted as data features. Non-geographically registered data of differing mesh structures can be visually correlated via cartographic warping of underlying geometries without interpolation. Since this approach is independent of realization technique, it provides a framework for experimenting with different visualization strategies. This methodology preserves the fidelity of the original data sets in a coordinate system suitable for three-dimensional, dynamic examination of upper atmospheric phenomena.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this paper we present a method, and a software based on this method, making highly inter-active visualization possible for computational results on nonlinear BVPs associated with ODEs. The program PCR relies partly on computer graphics tools and partly on real-time computations, the combination of which not only helps the understanding of complex problems, it also permits the reduction of stored data by orders of magnitude. The method has been implemented on PCs (running on DOS) and on the Application Visualization System (AVS) for UNIX machines, this paper provides a brief introduction to the latter version besides describing the mathematical background of the method.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Parallel program visualization and debugging require new techniques for gathering and displaying execution trace and profile data. Interaction with the program during execution is also required to facilitate parallel debugging. We discuss the difficulties associated with runtime user/program interaction and how the data-parallel programming paradigm facilitates much more liberal runtime interaction than typical MIMD-based models. We present a model for data-parallel program visualization that addresses both data collection/interaction and visualization issues. We follow our model presentation with the design and implementation of a subset of our visualization model. We discuss our preliminary findings and propose future research directions.
The anterior surface of the eye ('cornea') is extremely important for good sight. Instruments measuring corneal shape conventionally visualize the surface characteristics by mapping the instantaneous radius of curvature onto a rainbow colour scale. This technique is known to have important drawbacks. Firstly, not corneal shape itself is visualized, but rather second order surface properties. Secondly, the type of colouring produces well documented artifacts. We discuss visualization techniques for a more direct representation of the data. In a three part display, shape deviations are presented as a height surface in one window, height lines superimposed over the input image in another, and a colour mapped representation of the mean normal radius of curvature in a third. With the aid of some typical examples, it is shown that these visualizations are easy to interpret by the physician and overcome the limitations of the conventional techniques.
Having a better way to represent and to interact with large geological models are topics of high interest in geoscience, and especially for oil and gas companies. We present the design and implementation of a visualization program that involves two main features. It is based on the central data model, in order to display in real time the modifications caused by the modeler. Furthermore, it benefits from the different immersive environments which give the user a much more accurate insight of the model than a regular computer screen. Then, we focus on the difficulties that come in the way of performance.
Presents a method to estimate illumination dependent properties in image synthesis prior to rendering. A preprocessing step is described in which a linear image basis is developed and a lighting-independent formulation defined. A reflection function, similar to hemispherical reflectance, approximates normal Lambertian shading. Intensity errors resulting from this approximation are reduced by use of a polynomial gamma correction function and scaling to a normalized display range. This produces images that are similar to normal Lambertian shading without employing the maximum (max) function. For a single object view, images can then be expressed in a linear form so that lighting direction can be factored out. During normal rendering, image quantities for arbitrary light directions can be found without rendering. This method is demonstrated for estimating image intensity and level-of-detail error prior to rendering an object.
We describe a visualization system designed for interactive study of proteins in the field of computational biology. Our system incorporates multiple, custom, three-dimensional and two-dimensional linked views of the proteins. We take advantage of modem commodity graphics cards, which are typically designed for games rather than scientific visualization applications, to provide instantaneous linking between views and three-dimensional interactivity on standard personal computers. Furthermore, we anticipate the usefulness of game techniques such as bump maps and skinning for scientific applications.
In this paper, we address the problem of historical data visualization. We describe the data acquisition, preparation, and visualization. Since the data contain four dimensions, the standard 3D exploration techniques have to be extended or appropriately adapted in order to enable interactive exploration. We discuss in detail two interaction concepts: (1) navigation with one fixed dimension, and (2) quasi 4D navigation allowing to simultaneously explore the four-dimensional space. In addition, we also present a picture-in-picture display mode, enabling the user to interactively view the data, while "flying with" a particular event, tracking its motion in time and space. Finally, we present a technique for guided exploration and animation generation, allowing for a vivid gain of insight into the historical data.
Visualization is required for the effective utilization of data from a weather simulation. Appropriate mapping of user goals to the design of pictorial content has been useful in the development of interactive applications with sufficient bandwidth for timely access to the model data. When remote access to the model visualizations is required the limited bandwidth becomes the primary bottleneck. To help address these problems, visualizations are presented on a Web page as a meta-representation of the model output and serve as an index to simplify finding other visualizations of relevance. To provide consistency with extant interactive products and to leverage their cost of development, the aforementioned applications are adapted to automatically populate a Web site with images and interactions for an operational weather forecasting system.
The Gauss map projects surface normals to a unit sphere, providing a powerful visualization of the geometry of a graphical object. it can be used to predict visual events caused by changes in lighting, shading, and camera control. We present an interactive technique for portraying the Gauss map of polygonal models, mapping surface normals and the magnitudes of surface curvature using a spherical projection. Unlike other visualizations of surface curvature, we create our Gauss map directly from polygonal meshes without requiring any complex intermediate calculations of differential geometry. For anything other than simple shapes, surface information is densely mapped into the Gaussian normal image, inviting the use of visualization techniques to amplify and emphasize details hidden within the wealth of data. We present the use of interactive visualization tools such as brushing and linking to explore the surface properties of solid shapes. The Gauss map is shown to be simple to compute, easy to view dynamically, and effective at portraying important features of polygonal models.
A new method was developed to increase the saliency of changing variables in a cardiovascular visualization for use by anesthesiologists in the operating room (OR). Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects (Gescheider, 1976, Spence, 1990, and Baird, 1970). These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object's attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist's performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events (Agutter et al., 2002). In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient's cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.
Volume rendering and isosurface extraction from three-dimensional scalar fields are mostly based on piecewise trilinear representations. In regions of high geometric complexity such visualization methods often exhibit artifacts, due to trilinear interpolation. In this work, we present an iterative fairing method for scalar fields interpolating function values associated with grid points while smoothing the contours inside the grid cells based on variational principles. We present a local fairing method providing a piecewise bicubic representation of two-dimensional scalar fields. Our algorithm generalizes to the trivariate case and can be used to increase the resolution of data sets either locally or globally, reducing interpolation artifacts. In contrast to filtering methods, our algorithm does not reduce geometric detail supported by the data.
An important challenge encountered during post-processing of finite element analyses is the visualizing of three-dimensional fields of real-valued second-order tensors. Namely, as finite element meshes become more complex and detailed, evaluation and presentation of the principal stresses becomes correspondingly problematic. In this paper, we describe techniques used to visualize simulations of perturbed in-situ stress fields associated with hypothetical salt bodies in the Gulf of Mexico. We present an adaptation of the Mohr diagram, a graphical paper and pencil method used by the material mechanics community for estimating coordinate transformations for stress tensors, as a new tensor glyph for dynamically exploring tensor variables within three-dimensional finite element models. This interactive glyph can be used as either a probe or a filter through brushing and linking.



The evolution of computational science over the last decade has resulted in a dramatic increase in raw problem solving capabilities. This growth has given rise to advances in scientific and engineering simulations that have put a high demand on tools for high-performance large-scale data exploration and analysis. These simulations have the potential to generate large amounts of data. Humans, however are relatively poor at gaining insight from raw numerical data, and as a result, have used visualization as a tool for understanding, interpreting and exploring data of all types and sizes. Allowing for efficient visual explorations of data, however, requires that the ratio of knowledge gained versus the cost of the visualization be maximized. This, in turn, mandates the integration of principles from human perception. Understanding perception as it relates to visualization requires that we understand not only the biology of the human visual system, but principles from vision theory, and perceptual psychology as well. This panel is the result of bringing together practioners and researchers from a broad spectrum of interests relating to the ability to maximize the amount of information that is effectively perceived from a given visualization. Position statements will be given by researchers interested in perceptual psychology and the perception of natural images, integrating art and design principles, non-photorealistic rendering techniques, and the use of global illumination methods to provide benefical perceptual cues.
Current practice in particle visualization renders particle position data directly onto the screen as points or glyphs. Using a camera placed at a fixed position, particle motions can be visualized by rendering trajectories or by animations. Applying such direct techniques to large, time dependent particle data sets often results in cluttered images in which the dynamic properties of the underlying system are difficult to interpret. In this case study we take an alternative approach to the visualization of ion motions. Instead of rendering ion position data directly, we first extract meaningful motion information from the ion position data and then map this information onto geometric primitives. Our goal is to produce high-level visualizations that reflect the physicists' way of thinking about ion dynamics. Parameterized geometric icons are defined to encode motion information of clusters of related ions. In addition, a parameterized camera control mechanism is used to analyze relative instead of only absolute ion motions. We apply the techniques to simulations of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) experiments. The data produced by such simulations can amount to 5.10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ions and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; timesteps. This paper discusses the requirements, design and informal evaluation of the implemented system
In this paper, we introduce a novel application of volume modeling techniques on laser Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) therapy simulation. The core technique in our system is an algorithm for simulating the tissue vaporization process by laser heating. Different from classical volume CSG operations, our technique takes experimental data as the guidance to determine the vaporization amount so that only a specified amount of tissue is vaporized in each time. Our algorithm uses a predictor-corrector strategy. First, we apply the classical CSG algorithm on a tetrahedral grid based distance field to estimate the vaporized tissue amount. Then, a volume-correction phase is applied on the distance field. To improve the performance, we further propose optimization approaches for efficient implementation.
As microscopes have a very shallow depth of field, Z-stacks (i.e. sets of images shot at different focal planes) are often acquired to fully capture a thick sample. Such stacks are viewed by users by navigating them through the mouse wheel. We propose a new technique of visualizing 3D point, line or area markers in such focus stacks, by displaying them with a depth-dependent defocus, simulating the microscope's optics; this leverages on the microscopists' ability to continuously twiddle focus, while implicitly performing a shape-from-focus reconstruction of the 3D structure of the sample. User studies confirm that the approach is effective, and can complement more traditional techniques such as color-based cues. We provide two implementations, one of which computes defocus in real time on the GPU, and examples of their application.
Computer graphics has long been concerned with representing and displaying surfaces in three-dimensional space. The author addresses the questions of representation and display in a higher dimensional setting, specifically, that of 3-manifolds immersed in four-dimensional space. The author describes techniques for visualizing the cross-section surfaces of a 3-manifold formed by a cutting hyperplane. The manifold is first triangulated, so that the cross-section may be computed on a per tetrahedron basis. The triangulated manifold is stored in a data structure which efficiently supports calculation of curvature. These techniques have been implemented on Personal IRIS.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Experimental investigations into the application of intelligent robot control technology to the problem of removing waste stored in tanks is discussed. The authors describe the experimental environment used, with particular attention to the hardware and software control environment and the graphical interface. Intelligent system control is achieved through the integration of extensive geometric and kinematic world models with real-time sensor-based control. All operator interactions with the system are through fully animated graphical representations which validate all operator commands before execution to provide for safe operation. Sensing is used to add information to the robot system's world model and to allow sensor-based servo control during selected operations. The results of an initial critical features test are reported, and the potential to apply advanced intelligent control concepts to the removal of waste in storage tanks is discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A description is given of the computer graphics aspects of two architectures designed for imaging and graphics. The two systems use parallel and pipelined architectures for high-performance graphics operations. UWGPSP3 uses only commercially available off-the-shelf chips, and consists of a TM34020 graphics system processor and four TMS34082 floating point coprocessors that can be configured into pipelined or SIMD modes depending on the algorithm. UWGSP4 uses dedicated ASIC chips for higher performance, and consists of two main computational parts: a parallel vector processor with 16 vector processing units, used mainly for image processing, and a graphics subsystem which utilizes a parallel pipelined architecture for image synthesis.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Issues and difficulties involved in the practical implementation of flow visualization techniques based on a database generated in numerical simulations of unsteady square jets are addressed. Instantaneous visualizations provide basic information on the topological features of the flow, while animation of these visualizations gives an insight into the detailed dynamics of formation, development, and interaction of the coherent structures controlling the entrainment and mixing processes.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
New display technologies have begun to provide more innovative and potentially powerful methods to present information to a viewer. However, many of these techniques struggle to deliver accurate full color. In this paper, we address this difficulty by employing the dichromatic theory of color reflection, which implies that many objects can be rendered accurately using only two primaries. Complex display systems with two primaries can be produced with significantly less work than is required for the traditional three primaries. We discuss methods for selecting objects that can be rendered accurately on two-color displays, and we present our experiments with a two-color display using monochromatic primaries.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In the process of archaeological excavation, a vast amount of data, much of it three-dimensional in nature, is recorded. In recent years, computer graphics techniques have been applied to the task of visualizing such data. In particular, data visualization has been used to accomplish the virtual reconstruction of site architecture and to enable the display of spatial data distributions using three-dimensional models of site terrain. In the case we present here, these two approaches are integrated in the modeling of a prehistoric pithouse. In order to better visualize artifact distributions in the context of site architecture, surface data is displayed as a layer in a virtual reconstruction viewable at interactive rates. This integration of data display with the architectural model has proven valuable in identifying correlations between distributions of different artifact categories and their spatial proximity to significant architectural features.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Cortex has been designed for interactive analysis and display of simulation data generated by CFD applications based on unstructured-grid solvers. Unlike post-processing visualization environments, Cortex is designed to work in co-processing mode with the CFD application. This significantly reduces data storage and data movement requirements for visualization and also allows users to interactively steer the application. Further, Cortex supports high-performance by running on massively parallel computers and workstation clusters. An important goal for Cortex, is to provide visualization to a variety of solvers which differ in their solution methodologies and supported flow models. Coupled with the co-processing requirement, this has required the development of a well defined programming interface to the CFD solver that lets the visualization system communicate efficiently with the solver, and requires minimal programming effort for porting to new solvers. Further, the requirement for targeting multiple solvers and application niches demands that the visualization system be rapidly and easily modifiable. Such flexibility is attained in Cortex by using the high-level, interpreted language Scheme for implementing user-interfaces and high-level visualization functions. By making the Scheme interpreter available from the Cortex text interface, the user can also customize and extend the visualization system.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a new technique for the visualization and analysis of the results from Monte Carlo simulations based on /spl alpha/-complexes and /spl alpha/-shapes. The specific application presented is the analysis of the quantum-mechanical behavior of hydrogen molecules and helium atoms on a surface at very low temperatures. The technique is an improvement over existing techniques in two respects. First, the approach allows one to visualize the points on a random walk at varying levels of detail and interactively select the level of detail that is most appropriate. Second, using /spl alpha/-shapes one can obtain quantitative measures of spatial properties of the system, such as the boundary length and interior area of clusters, that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Spherical color maps can be an effective tool in the microstructure visualization of polycrystals. Electron backscatter diffraction pattern analysis provides large arrays of the orientation data that can be visualized easily using the technique described in this paper. A combination of this technique with the traditional black and white scanning electron microscopy imaging will enable scientists to better understand the correlation between material properties and their polycrystalline structure.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Many practical problems in open channel hydraulics that were traditionally investigated in hydraulic model experiments, are nowadays being solved by using computational fluid dynamics. However, in order to interpret computational results, there is a clear preference among scientists and engineers for visualization in analogy with experimental techniques. One such technique, particle tracing, enables a dynamic (Lagrangian) interpretation of a statically (Eulerian) computed vector field. However, quite often the emphasis in particle tracing is only on the mean flow properties, while effects due to dispersion and mixing are often not accounted for. Hence turbulent flow characteristics have to be incorporated in a visualization system for practical hydraulic engineering problems. The particle tracing technique presented in this case study has been specifically developed to combine both mean and fluctuating velocity vectors, thus simulating stochastic perturbations around mean flow conditions. A number of cases are presented that demonstrate the practical applicability of advanced visualization techniques in realistic engineering studies.
We describe a multidisciplinary effort for creating interactive 3D graphical modules for visualizing optical phenomena. These modules are designed for use in an upper-level undergraduate course. The modules are developed in Open Inventor, which allows them to run under both Unix and Windows. The work is significant in that it applies contemporary interactive 3D visualization techniques to instructional courseware, which represents a considerable advance compared to the current state of the practice.
This paper describes a project that combined physical model fabrication and virtual computer-based data display to create a unique visualization presentation. USGS terrain information on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska was used to create a physical prototype in SDSC's TeleManufacturing Facility. This model was then used as a mold to create a translucent plate of the terrain. Finally, deforestation data from the island was color mapped and rear-projected onto the translucent plate within a light box. The result is a very compelling display in which both the senses of sight and touch are used to make relationships between terrain features and the data more readily apparent.
Perhaps the most effective instrument to simplify and to clarify the comprehension of any complex mathematical or scientific theory is through visualisation. Moreover using interactivity and 3D real time representations, one can easily explore and hence learn quickly in the virtual environments. The concept of virtual and safe laboratories has vast potentials in education. With the aid of computer simulations and 3D visualisations, many dangerous or cumbersome experiments may be implemented in the virtual environments, with rather small effort. Nonetheless visualisation alone is of little use if the respective simulation is not scientifically accurate. Hence a rigorous combination of precise computation as well as sophisticated visualisation, presented through some intuitive user interface is required to realise a virtual laboratory for education. We introduce Delta's Virtual Physics Laboratory, comprising a wide range of applications in the field of physics and astronomy, which can be implemented and used as an interactive learning tool on the World Wide Web.
Polyhedral meshes are used for visualization, computer graphics or geometric modeling purposes and result from many applications like iso-surface extraction, surface reconstruction or CAD/CAM. The paper introduces a method for constructing smooth surfaces from a triangulated polyhedral mesh of arbitrary topology. It presents a new algorithm which generalizes and improves the triangle 4-split method (S. Hahmann and G.-P. Bonneau) in the crucial point of boundary curve network construction. This network is then filled in by a visual smooth surface from which an explicit closed form parametrization is given. Furthermore, the method becomes now completely local and can interpolate normal vector input at the mesh vertices.
The paper describes the effective real-time visualization of the clear-up operation of a former US nuclear submarine base, located in Holy Loch, Scotland. The Whole Field Modelling System has provided an extremely accurate real-time visualization of a large number of varying parameters such as remotely operated vehicles, cranes, barges, grabs, magnets, and detailed seabed topography. The system has improved the field staffs' spatial and temporal awareness of the underwater environment and facilitated decision-making within the complex offshore working environment.
PingTV generates a logical map of a network that is used as an overlay on a physical geographical image of the location from the user perspective (buildings, floors within buildings, etc.). PingTV is used at Illinois State University as a visualization tool to communicate real-time network conditions to the university community via a dedicated channel on the campus cable TV system. Colored symbols allow students and staff to discern high-congestion "rush hours" and understand why their specific Internet connectivity is "broken" from the wide range of potential causes. Lessons learned include the use of color to visually convey confidence intervals using color shading and the visualization of cyclical network traffic patterns. Our implementation is general and flexible with potential for application for other domains.
This paper presents a novel use of visualization applied to debugging the Cplant/sup TM/ cluster hardware at Sandia National Laboratories. As commodity cluster systems grow in popularity and grow in size, tracking component failures within the hardware will become more and more difficult. We have developed a tool that facilitates visual debugging of errors within the switches and cables connecting the processors. Combining an abstract system model with color-coding for both error and job information enables failing components to be identified.
Brain imaging methods used in experimental brain research such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) require the analysis of large amounts of data. Exploratory statistical methods can be used to generate new hypotheses and to provide a reliable measure of a given effect. Typically, researchers report their findings by listing those regions which show significant statistical activity in a group of subjects under some experimental condition or task. A number of methods create statistical parametric maps (SPMs) of the brain on a voxel-basis. In our approach statistics are computed not on individual voxels but on predefined anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). A correlation coefficient is used to quantify similarity in response for various regions during an experimental setting. Since the functional inter-relationships can become rather complex and spatially widespread, they are best understood in the context of the underlying 3-D brain anatomy. However despite the power of the 3-D model, the relative location of ROIs in 3-D can be obscured due the inherent problem of presenting 3-D spatial information on a 2-D screen. In order to address this problem, we have explored a number of visualization techniques to aid the brain researcher in exploring the spatial relationships of brain activity. In this paper we present a novel 3-D interface that allows the interactive exploration of correlation datasets.
We present techniques for discovering and exploiting regularity in large curvilinear data sets. The data can be based on a single mesh or a mesh composed of multiple submeshes (also known as zones). Multi-zone data are typical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Regularities include axis-aligned rectilinear and cylindrical meshes as well as cases where one zone is equivalent to a rigid body transformation of another. Our algorithms can also discover rigid-body motion of meshes in time-series data. Next, we describe a data model where we can utilize the results from the discovery process in order to accelerate large data visualizations. Where possible, we replace general curvilinear zones with rectilinear or cylindrical zones. In rigid-body motion cases, we replace a time-series of meshes with a transformed mesh object where a reference mesh is dynamically transformed based on a given time value in order to satisfy geometry requests, on demand. The data model enables us to make these substitutions and dynamic transformations transparently with respect to the visualization algorithms. We present results with large data sets where we combine our mesh replacement and transformation techniques with out-of-core paging in order to achieve analysis speedups ranging from 1.5 to 2.

Waves are a fundamental mechanism for conveying information in many physical problems. Direct visualization techniques are often used to display wave fronts. However, the information derived from such visualizations may not be as central to an investigation as an understanding of how the location, structure and time course of the wave change as key experimental parameters are varied. In experimental data, these questions are confounded by noise and incomplete data. Recognition of waves in networks of neurons is additionally complicated by the presence of long-range physical connections and recurrent excitation. This work applies visual techniques to analyze the structural details of waves in response data from the turtle visual cortex. We emphasize low-cost visualizations that allow comparisons across neural data sets and variables to reconstruct the choreography for a complex response.
Scientific Visualization (SciVis) has evolved past the point where one undergraduate course can cover all of the necessary topics. So the question becomes "how do we teach SciVis to this generation of students?" Some examples of current courses are: A graduate Computer Science (CS) course that prepares the next generation of SciVis researchers. An undergraduate CS course that prepares the future software architects/developers of packages such as vtk, vis5D and AVS. A class that teaches students how to do SciVis with existing software packages and how to deal with the lack of interoperability between those packages (via either a CS service course or a supercomputing center training course). An inter-disciplinary course designed to prepare computer scientists to work with the "real" scientists (via either a CS or Computational Science course). In this panel, we will discuss these types of courses and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We will also talk about some issues that you have probably encountered at your university: How do we keep the graphics/vis-oriented students from going to industry? How does SciVis fit in with evolving Computational Science programs? Is SciVis destined to be a service course at most universities? How do we deal with the diverse backgrounds of students that need SciVis?
New high-throughput proteomic techniques generate data faster than biologists can analyze it. Hidden within this massive and complex data are answers to basic questions about how cells function. The data afford an opportunity to take a global or systems approach studying whole proteomes comprising all the proteins in an organism. However, the tremendous size and complexity of the high-throughput data make it difficult to process and interpret. Existing tools for studying a few proteins at a time are not suitable for global analysis. Visualization provides powerful analysis capabilities for enormous, complex data at multiple resolutions. We developed a novel interactive visualization tool, PQuad, for the visual analysis of proteins and peptides identified from high-throughput data on biological samples. PQuad depicts the peptides in the context of their source protein and DNA, thereby integrating proteomic and genomic information. A wrapped line metaphor is applied across key resolutions of the data, from a compressed view of an entire chromosome to the actual nucleotide sequence. PQuad provides a difference visualization for comparing peptides from samples prepared under different experimental conditions. We describe the requirements for such a visual analysis tool, the design decisions, and the novel aspects of PQuad.
We have developed a real-time experiment-control and data-display system for a novel microscope, the 3D-force microscope (3DFM), which is designed for nanometer-scale and nanoNewton-force biophysical experiments. The 3DFM software suite synthesizes the several data sources from the 3DFM into a coherent view and provides control over data collection and specimen manipulation. Herein, we describe the system architecture designed to handle the several feedback loops and data flows present in the microscope and its control system. We describe the visualization techniques used in the 3DFM software suite, where used, and on which types of data. We present feedback from our scientist-users regarding the usefulness of these techniques, and we also present lessons learned from our successive implementations.
The animation of two-dimensional objects in a 2-D planar environment is discussed. The use of chain codes as a boundary representation for 2-D objects undergoing animation is shown to be practical for several typical transformations. Various methods for implementing the transformations are described. Quantized methods transform groups of chain code elements into other groups, while incremental methods construct the transformed chain code element by element. The low cost of quantized methods, which rely on table lookup and minimal arithmetic, are weighed against the increased accuracy offered by incremental methods, which maintain error indicators to ensure minimal differences between ideal and generated chain codes. Methods for scaling, rotation, and elastic deformation of objects based solely on chain code elements are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors describe some simple visualization techniques that may be used to explore dynamic three-dimensional scalar fields in an interactive way. Scalar data are assumed to have been already computed, and graphic manipulations are done afterwards on a graphics workstation. Structured grids (finite-difference grids) are used, leading to an easy and fast exploration of the interior of a volume. Smooth animation and simultaneous visualization of two or three scalar fields is described. These methods were tested on various types of data from different fields of petroleum engineering, i.e. oil reservoir simulation, geophysics, geology, and combustion engine simulations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volumetric rendering is applied to the interpretation of atomic-scale data generated from quantum molecular dynamics computations. In particular, for silicon computations it is found that volumetric visualization of the computed 3D electronic charge density is a valuable tool for identifying defect states in silicon lattices in which oxygen atoms occur as impurities. Rendering of several judiciously selected ranges of charge density in translucent colors provides an effective means of identifying broken or altered molecular bonds and induced charge excesses in the lattice. The resulting 3D images reveal important features missed previously in 2D charge density contour maps. Stereoscopic 'blink comparison' of image pairs is an extremely valuable way to study the structural differences among various configurations, and animation provides significant insight into the molecular dynamics.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An algorithm based on mathematical morphology, image processing, and volume rendering has been developed to enhance the visual perception of definite and abstract structures embedded in multidimensional data undergoing visualization. This erosion procedure enhances the depth and shape perception of structures present in the data beyond the perception facilitated by shading and contrasting colors alone. The utility of this algorithm is demonstrated for medical imaging (positron emission tomography) and climate (sea surface temperature) data. The resulting information is displayed in stereo.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The McClellan Air Force Base Installation Restoration Program (IRP), which is responsible for identifying and remedying environmental contamination from past operation and disposal practices, is considered. Since 1979, the IRP has generated over 200 volumes of technical reports regarding the degree and extent of contamination at the base. The base is in the process of automating the storage, retrieval, and analysis of the technical data generated by the cleanup program. The requirements for the IRP technical information system are discussed, the development approach taken is presented, visualization results from the system prototype are illustrated, and future plans for development of the system are outlined.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A Universe mapping project at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), called the CfA Redshift Survey, is described. The line-of-sight recession velocities of galaxies are measured by identifying absorption and emission lines in their spectra. With the two angular positions of a galaxy on the sky and a measurement of its red-shift, each galaxy can be placed in a three-dimensional (3-D) map of the Universe. It is shown that visualization techniques are important for exploring and analyzing the data, for comparing the data with models, and for designing the future. Computer animation of the data is a way of bringing the maps before the public.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A recent study of a flow detail of an engine intake of future ground to orbit transport systems provided extremely complex data from numerical flow simulation and experimental flow visualization. The data posed a challenging problem to flow visualization, computational flow imaging (CFI), and the comparison of experimental imaging techniques versus computational imaging techniques. Some new visualization techniques have been implemented to provide compact representations of the complex features in the data. It turned out to be most useful to combine various specialized techniques for an icon-like representation of phenomena in a single image in order to study interaction of flow features. Some lessons were learned by simulating experimental visualization techniques on the numerical data.
We present a system where visualization and the control of the simulation are integrated to facilitate interactive exploration and modeling of large data sets. The system was developed to estimate properties of the atmosphere of Venus from comparison between measured and simulated data. Reuse of results, distributed computing, and multiple views on the data were the major ingredients to create an effective environment.
We are studying difficult geometric problems in computer-aided mechanical design where visualization plays a key role. The research addresses the fundamental design task of contact analysis: deriving the part contacts and the ensuing motion constraints in a mechanical system. We have automated contact analysis of general planar systems via configuration space computation. Configuration space is a geometric representation of rigid-body interaction that encodes quantitative information, such as part motion paths, and qualitative information, such as system failure modes. The configuration space dimension equals the number of degrees of freedom in the system. Three-dimensional spaces are most important, but higher-dimensions are often useful. The qualitative aspects, which relate to the topology of the configuration space, are best understood by visualization. We explain what configuration space is, how it encodes contact information, and what research challenges it poses for visualization.

The detailed underwater bathymetric data provided by Sonar Research and Development's high speed multi-frequency sonar transducer system provides new challenges in the development of interactive seabed visualization tools. The paper introduces a "Whole Field Modelling" system developed at Sonar Research and Development Ltd and The Department of Computer Science, University of Hull. This system provides the viewer with a new 3D underwater visualization environment that allows the user to pilot a virtual underwater vehicle around an accurate seabed model. We consider two example case studies that use the Whole Field Modelling system for visualizing sonar data. Both case studies, visualizing real time pipeline dredging and pipe restoration visualization, are implemented using real survey data.

The automotive industry demands visual support for the verification of the quality of their products from the design phase to the manufacturing phase. This implies the need of tools for measurement planning, programming measuring devices, managing measurement data, and the visual exploration of the measurement results. To improve the quality control throughout the whole process chain an integration of such tools in a platform independent framework is crucial. We present eMMA (enhanced Measure Management Application), a client/server system integrating measurement planning, data management, and straightforward as well as sophisticated visual exploration tools in a single framework.
This paper describes a Data Management System for Multimedial Information Visualization called DaMI. It is possible to create 2D or 3D model based on data out of standard databases and additional metainformation. DaMI is a generic system guaranteeing an optimal reusability and compatibility.


We present a novel scheme to interactively visualize time-varying scalar fields defined on a structured grid. The underlying approach is to maximize the use of current graphics hardware by using 3D texture mapping. This approach commonly suffers from an expensive voxelization of each time-step as well as from large size of the voxel array approximating each step. Hence, in our scheme, instead of explicitly voxelizing each scalar field, we directly store each time-step as a three dimensional texture in its native form. We create the function that warps a voxel grid into the given structured grid. At rendering time, we reconstruct the function at each pixel using hardware-based trilinear interpolation. The resulting coordinates allow us to compute the scalar value at this pixel using a second texture lookup. For fixed grids, the function remains constant across time-steps and only the scalar field table needs to be re-loaded as a texture. Our new approach achieves excellent performance with relatively low texture memory requirements and low approximation error.

A package that can bridge the connection between scattered data sets and the highly structured sets required by graphics algorithms is described. Although export of evaluation data is a necessary capability, it is very important that this package has a fully featured three-dimensional graphics subsystem to interactively guide the researcher toward the final visualization results. At that point the option exists of using more sophisticated and more powerful graphics tools to achieve the desired presentation. The application presented has been designed to effectively meet these needs and to promote the awareness of the value of interpolation tools in visualization. Full details of this design are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This work briefly describes our approach to visualize results of transient flow simulations in the application areas of groundwater flow and pollutant transport as well as compressible fluid flow in engine parts. The simulations use finite element data structures and can have geometries which change over time. We designed a client-server model to handle the huge amount of data that can be obtained either directly from the simulation process or from files on disk. As standard visualization packages are not able to cope with transient unstructured data, we implemented streamlines, stream surfaces and particle systems as our main visualization methods. Our experiences and results with these techniques are discussed in this paper.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visualization will be vital to the success of the NASA EOS Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE), which will gather, generate, and distribute an unprecedented volume of data for the purpose of global change research and environmental policy decisions. The paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities for visualization with regard to the Mission to Planet Earth. Directions presently being taken within NASA to fund and assist development of new tools are also discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Ash clouds resulting from volcanic eruptions are a serious hazard to aviation safety. In Alaska alone, there are over 40 active volcanoes whose eruptions may affect more than 40,000 flights using the great circle polar routes each year. The clouds are especially problematic because they are invisible to radar and nearly impossible to distinguish from weather clouds. The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Alaska Volcano Observatory have collaborated to develop a system for predicting and visualizing the movement of volcanic ash clouds when an eruption occurs. The output from the model is combined with a digital elevation model to produce a realistic view of the ash cloud which may be examined interactively from any desired point of view at any time during the prediction period. This paper describes the visualization techniques employed in the system and includes a video animation of the 1989 Mount Redoubt eruption which caused complete engine failure on a 747 passenger jet.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visualization, animation, and simulation techniques are applied to the problem of rotor design for helicopters. Periodic unsteady experimental velocity data (laser Doppler velocimetry or LDV) in two dimensions and velocity data derived from simulated vortex systems in three dimensions are compared using the same visual tools. Animations show the development of rotor wake systems and induced velocities over time. Modified particle trace integration schemes are used to calculate steady streamlines and unsteady particle paths for both kinds of data. In an extension of this work, a virtual environment (VE) system was used to view the wake vortex system and an interactive probe was used to explore the induced velocity field. Future work will enable interactive visual debugging and simulation steering.
The investigation of mechanisms responsible for the morphogenesis of complex biological organisms is an important area in biology. P. patens is an especially suitable plant for this research because it is a rather simple organism, facilitating its observation, yet it possesses developmental phenomena analogous to those which occur in higher plants, allowing the extrapolation of hypotheses to more complex organisms. The visualization consists of three components: biological data collection, computer-modelling (using L-systems), and model verification. The simulated developmental process is quite realistic and provides an excellent means for verifying the underlying hypotheses of morphogenesis.
Outputs from a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PB-TK) model for fish were visualized by mapping time series data for specific tissues onto a three dimensional representation of a rainbow trout. The trout representation was generated in stepwise fashion: cross sectional images were obtained from an anesthetized fish using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system; images were processed to classify tissue types; images were stacked and processed to create a three dimensional representation of the fish, encapsulating five volumes corresponding to the liver, kidney, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and fat. Kinetic data for the disposition of pentachloroethane in trout were generated using a PB-TK model. Model outputs were mapped onto corresponding tissue volumes, representing chemical concentration as color intensity. The visualization was then animated, to show the accumulation of pentachloroethane in each tissue during a continuous branchial (gill) exposure.
Sampling and analysis of subsurface contaminants comprise the first steps toward environmental remediation of hazardous spills. We have developed software tools to support the analysis phase, using three different schemes for interpolating scattered 3D soil-quality data onto a grid suitable for viewing in an interactive visualization system. A good interpolation scheme is one that respects the distribution of the original data. We find that the original data can be decimated by up to seventy percent while exhibiting graceful degradation in quality. A prototype software system is being deployed to allow technicians to visually determine, while in the field with their monitoring equipment, where the highest concentrations of contaminants lie. The system is now in use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Situational awareness applications require a highly detailed geospatial visualization covering a large geographic area. Conventional polygon based terrain modeling would exceed the capacity of current computer rendering. Terrain visualization techniques for a situational awareness application are described in this case study. Visualizing large amounts of terrain data has been achieved using very large texture maps. Sun shading is applied to the terrain texture map to enhance perception of relief features. Perception of submarine positions has been enhanced using a translucent, textured water surface.

Geometric models are often annotated to provide additional information during visualization. Maps may be marked with rivers, roads or topographical information, and CAD data models may highlight the underlying mesh structure. While this additional information may be extremely useful, there is a rendering cost associated with it. Texture maps have often been used to convey this information at relatively low cost, but they suffer from blurring and pixelization at high magnification. We present a technique for simplifying surface annotations based on directed, asymmetric tolerance. By maintaining the annotations as geometry, as opposed to textures, we are able to simplify them while still maintaining the overall appearance of the model over a wide range of magnifications. Texture maps may still be used to provide low-resolution surface detail, such as color. We demonstrate a significant gain in rendering performance while retaining the original appearance of objects from many application domains.
Visualization can be an important tool for displaying, categorizing and digesting large quantities of inter-related information during laboratory and simulation experiments. Summary visualizations that compare and represent data sets in the context of a collection are particularly valuable. Applicable visualizations used in these settings must be fast (near real time) and should allow the addition of data sets as they are acquired without requiring rerendering of the visualization. This paper examines several visualization techniques for representing collections of data sets in a combustion experiment including spectral displays, tiling and geometric mappings of symmetry. The application provides insight into how such visualizations might be used in practical real-time settings to assist in exploration and in conducting parameter space surveys.

The visualization of any vector field is dependent on the relative velocity of the observer. In experimentally generated vector fields, the average value of the streamwise component of the global vector field is typically calculated and subtracted from each vector. We demonstrate that the resulting image, critical points, and vector field features are greatly influenced by the magnitude of the value subtracted from the streamwise velocity.
The purpose of visualization is not just to depict data, but to gain or present insight into the domain represented in data. However in visualization systems, this link between features in the data and the meaning of those features is often missing or implicit. It is assumed that the user, through looking at the output, will close the loop between representation and insight. An alternative is to view visualization tools as interfaces between data and insight, and to enrich this interface with capabilities linked to users’ conceptual models of the data. Preliminary work has been carried out to develop such an interface as a modular component that can be installed in a pipelined architecture. This poster expands the motivation for this work, and describes the initial implementation carried out within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
We present a simple yet effective method for modeling of object decomposition under combustion. A separate simulation models the flame production and generates heat from a combustion process, which is used to trigger pyrolysis of the solid object. The decomposition is modeled using level set methods, and can handle complex topological changes. Even with a very simple flame model on a coarse grid, we can achieve a plausible decomposition of the burning object.
We present a new level set method for reconstructing interfaces from point aggregations. Although level-set-based methods are advantageous because they can handle complicated topologies and noisy data, most tend to smooth the inherent roughness of the original data. Our objective is to enhance the quality of a reconstructed surface by preserving certain roughness-related characteristics of the original dataset. Our formulation employs the total variation of the surface as a roughness measure. The algorithm consists of two steps: a roughness-capturing flow and a roughness-preserving flow. The roughness capturing step attempts to construct a surface for which the original roughness is captured - distance flow is well suited for roughness capturing. Surface reconstruction is enhanced by using a total variation preserving (TVP) scheme for the roughness-preserving flow. The shock filter formulation of Osher and Rudin is exploited to achieve this goal. In practice, we have found that better results arc obtained by balancing the TVP term with a smoothing term based on curvature. The algorithm is applied to both fractal surface growth simulations and scanned data sets to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
The use of qualitative shape synthesis for the display of 3-D binary objects is presented. The proposed approach is applicable to multi-object scenes and to outdoor scenery as well. It makes use of a new method, the diffusion process, that simulates diffusion of particles within the interior of a 3-D discrete object. Starting with initial concentrations of particles at the boundary-voxels, the diffusion procedure simulates the propagation of these particles inwards. Boundary voxels of the object are colored according to the concentration of particles obtained by suspending the diffusion process. This method assists shape characterization by providing a qualitative measure of boundary curvature and was used in achieving display of a variety of voxel-based objects. Examples of the use of this approach on synthetic, terrain, and range data, are provided.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
An algorithm that creates planar and arbitrarily curved sections of free-form volumes is presented. The definition of free-form volumes generalizes techniques from free-form curves and surfaces to trivariate representation. The definition is given for volumes in the Bernstein-Bezier representation. The author illustrates an intersection algorithm that can be used to perform intersection operations on free-form volumes. Some calculated examples are given. The algorithm can be used as a subroutine for algorithms which are able to perform more general intersections of free-form volumes, e.g. Boolean operations on two free-form volumes.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This case study describes how visualization tools were used in a nonlinear finite-element method (FEM) analysis of rivet deformation. After summarizing the problem at hand, it is concluded that three factors that aided the visualization process in this case can be extracted as general principles: first, focus the viewer on the area of interest; second, do not confuse the viewer with strange color scales; and finally, do not try to convey too much information in one image. Images should convey a maximum amount of information with a minimum of confusion. In this particular case the most useful techniques proved to be animations of color-shaded contours, where the viewer could zoom in on any area of particular interest. Animation was used for each of the seven different data types produced by the analysis package.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visual data analysis (VDA) is a visualization approach that combines vector and raster graphics to provide insights into various aspects of multidimensional datasets. VDA methods have found application in aerospace engineering research, VDA is being used to develop nondestructive evaluation testing techniques for graphite epoxy composites by providing insights into stress waves propagating through them. Visual data analysis was used to analyze stress wave propagation, determine the origin of an unexplained wave distortion, and create a theoretical model to eliminate the distortion utilizing mathematical modeling.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Gray-scale diagrams, which can present large amounts of quantitative information in a compact format, are considered as a candidate for business charts. Hundreds of data points can easily be represented in one diagram, using small gray-scale squares (or tiles), without visually overloading a viewer. An experiment was done to compare the subjects' responses to questions from three types of charts, traditional column and line charts and gray-scale tile charts. The results showed that questions were answered more correctly and more quickly using gray-scale tile charts than using traditional charts. However, subjects reported they experienced more strain using gray-scale charts.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper looks at the issues involved in using a visualization software package to extend the scope of an existing suite of semiconductor modeling software. The visualization software and its hardware platform represent the state of the art in powerful interactive workstation visualization systems. A range of important issues to be considered when applying off-the-shelf visualization software to a real-world scientific problem is identified.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Work in progress at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) involving the implementation of network clients and servers to provide networkwide access to video devices is described. Applications anywhere on the net can manage record and playback operations, change video signal routing, or adjust scan converter parameters. Details of network communications, protocols, and device-specific control quirks are invisible to the user, making the video equipment a true network resource.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A fast range search algorithm for visualizing extrema of d-dimensional volume data in real time as the user interactively moves the query range is presented. The algorithm is based on an efficient data structure, called index heap, which needs only O(N/log N) space and O(d2/sup d/N) preprocessing time to be set up, where N is the size of the d-dimensional data volume. The algorithm can answer an extremum query in O(4/sup d/) expected time, and its worst-case time complexity is O(2/sup d/ log N) per query. For dimensions two and three, the range search for extrema is effected in average O(1) time per query independently of the size of query range. Unlike previous range query algorithms in the computational geometry literature, the proposed algorithm is very simple and can be easily implemented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Designers, implementers, and marketers of data analysis tools typically have different perspectives than end users. Consequently, data analysts often find themselves using tools focused on graphics and programming concepts rather than concepts which reflect their own domain and the context of their work. Some user studies focus on usability tests late in development; others observe work activity, but fail to show how to apply that knowledge in design. This paper describes a methodology for applying observations of data analysis work activity in prototype tool design. The approach can be used both in designing improved data analysis tools, and customizing visualization environments to specific applications. We present an example of user-centered design for a prototype tool to cull large data sets. We revisit the typical graphical approach of animating a large data set from the point of view of an analyst who is culling data. Field evaluations using the prototype tool not only revealed valuable usability information, but initiated in-depth discussions about user's work, tools, technology, and requirements.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
3-dimensional data visualization from any input source involves the study and understanding of several steps. These steps include data acquisition, signal processing, image processing and image generation. Using a forward-looking high frequency sonar system (which focuses sound much like the eye focuses light), standard and non-standard data processing algorithms, and industry "standard" visualization algorithms, this project produced accurate 3-dimensional representations of several underwater objects.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We present a new visualization approach to support design for manufacturing (DFM). This involves the correlation of manufacturing problems with the causative geometric characteristics. We then discuss the use of distance transform and 3-D thinning to extract these characteristics from a voxelized object. In contrast to current computer aided engineering (CAE) tools, our system is very efficient and simple to use. It does not require the skill and experience to generate and control a numerical mesh and interpret the results. The specifically tailored visualization system makes the results self-evident. Though the current domain is die casting, it could potentially be applied to many net shape processes.
Presents a new method for auralization of the vorticity of a streamline in a vector field. This technique involves using a composite tone formed by superimposing sine waves of various amplitudes whose frequency and amplitude vary in such a way as to give the perception that the resulting sound increases or decreases endlessly in pitch without ever extending beyond the listener's range of audible frequencies. Continuous clockwise or counterclockwise rotations of a streamline resulting from vorticity can then be displayed aurally as an apparently continuous increase or decrease in pitch.
Climatological data about thunderstorms is traditionally collected by balloons or planes traveling through the storm along straight tracts. Such data lends itself to simple 2D representations. The data described in this paper was gathered by a sail plane spiraling in an updraft within a thundercloud. The more complex organization of data samples demands more complex representation methods. This paper describes a system developed using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to explore such data. The data consists of several scalar values and a set of vector values associated with positional data on the measuring devices. The goal of this visualization is to explore the location of point charges suggested by the electromagnetic field vectors and determine if any correlation exists between the point charge location and standard cloud microstructure scalar measurements such as temperature. There are several problems associated with visualizing this rather unique set of data. They stem from the fact that the data is a sparse spiraling sample of scalars and vectors. The system allows the track of the plane to be displayed as a line, a tube or a ribbon; scalar values can be displayed as transparent isosurfaces; and the vector data as an arrow plot along that track, given a color that is constant, based on orientation or related to the value of a scalar. Any combination of methods can be used to display the data. A single primitive can be overloaded in many ways, or several different variables can all be displayed simultaneously.
Noise reduction is an important preprocessing step for many visualization techniques that make use of feature extraction. We propose a method for denoising 2-D vector fields that are corrupted by additive noise. The method is based on the vector wavelet transform and wavelet coefficient thresholding. We compare our wavelet-based denoising method with Gaussian filtering, and test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the vector fields before and after denoising. We also study the effect on relevant details for visualization, such as vortex measures. The results show that for low SNR, Gaussian filtering with large kernels has a somewhat higher performance than the wavelet-based method in terms of SNR. For larger SNR, the wavelet-based method outperforms Gaussian filtering. This is mostly due to the fact that Gaussian filtering tends to remove small details, which are preserved by the wavelet-based method.
In this paper we offer methods for visualization of the formation of nanoparticles in turbulent flows. We present the use of pointillism as a technique to convey the distribution of nanoparticle sizes as texture in an area. We also demonstrate a method of producing and packing spot glyphs representative of the distribution of nanoparticle sizes at every point in the flow to produce an intuitive and extensible framework for the visualization.
Summary form only given. A self-illustrating phenomenon is an image which exposes the science behind it. Some famous examples are pictures of iron filings aligned along magnetic lines of force, sand particles collecting at the stationary points of the standing waves of a violin, stress in a mechanical part revealed through birefringence, and particle tracks in a bubble chamber. Such images brilliantly combine experimental design, analysis, and visualization. Quoting J. Tukey, "the general purposes of conducting experiments and analyzing data match, point by point". We argue in this talk that computer tools for visual analysis should normally be conceived of as aids in constructing computational visual experiments; and that the resulting visualizations be consciously designed to help validate or invalidate the hypothesis being tested by the experiment.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the number one killer in the United States. Although it is well known that CHD mainly occurs due to blocked arteries, there are contradictory results from studies designed to identify basic causes for this common disease is. To find out more about the true reason for CHD, virtual models can be employed to better understand the way the heart functions. With such a model, scientists and surgeons are able to analyze the effects of different treatment options, and ultimately find more suited ways to prevent coronary heart diseases. To investigate a given model, appropriate navigation methods are required, including suitable input devices. For the visualization, graphics cards originally designed for gaming applications are used; so, it is a just natural transition to adapt gaming input devices to a visualization system for controlling of the navigation. These devices are usually well designed with respect to ergonomics and durability, yielding more degrees of freedom in steering than two-dimensional input devices, such as desktop mice. This poster describes a visualization system that provides the user with advanced control devices for navigation enabling interactive exploration of the model. Force-feedback and sound effects provide additional cues.
In this case study, a data-oriented approach is used to visualize a complex digital signal processing pipeline. The pipeline implements a frequency modulated (FM) software-defined radio (SDR). SDR is an emerging technology where portions of the radio hardware, such as filtering and modulation, are replaced by software components. We discuss how an SDR implementation is instrumented to illustrate the processes involved in FM transmission and reception. By using audio-encoded images, we illustrate the processes involved in radio, such as how filters are used to reduce noise, the nature of a carrier wave, and how frequency modulation acts on a signal. The visualization approach used in this work is very effective in demonstrating advanced topics in digital signal processing and is a useful tool for experimenting with the software radio design.
A method of visualizing equations in their explicit form using 3D fields is described. Equations are written algebraically, interpreted by an equation parser, and then expressed as scalar fields. Fields are represented as isosurfaces, making use of an algorithm similar to the method of marching cubes. The implementation allows the real-time interaction of equation parameters, isosurface rotations, and coloring. A variety of applications from mathematics and physics are given, together with examples of construction of data probes using equations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A computer was used to help study the packing of equal spheres in dimension four and higher. A candidate of the densest packing in 4-space is described. The configuration of 24 spheres touching a central sphere in this packing is shown to be rigid, unlike the analog in 3-space, in which the spheres can slide past each other. A system for interactively manipulating and visualizing such configurations is described. The Voronoi cell for a sphere is the set of points closer to its center than to any other sphere center in the packing. The packing density is the ratio of a sphere's volume to the average of the volumes of the Voronoi cells. A method of constructing Voronoi cells and computing their volumes that works in any dimension is presented. Examples of Voronoi cell volumes are given.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Software tools are traditionally connected using human-readable files, an approach that buys flexibility and understandability at some cost in performance relative to binary file formats. The possibility of using shared-memory functions to retain most of the existing style while leapfrogging the speed of reading binary files, at least in some environments and for some applications, is explored. Results of a benchmarking experiment confirm the benefits of this alternative.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The benefits of using a distributed scientific visualization tool in the field of acoustic modeling are demonstrated. A user-friendly interface was developed under SunView. A Remote Procedure Call was used for transparent data transfer between a CRAY X-MP/28 and Sun 4 workstation. PV-WAVE, a high-level graphics package, was used to visualize the results.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The author describes the interaction between computer graphics students from the computer science department at Rochester Institute of technology and faculty from various disciplines, in their attempts to utilize state-of-the-art computer graphics techniques for the visualization of physical systems. The structure of a computer graphics course designed to act as the vehicle for this interaction is also described.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Reports from five research centers involved with atmospheric and environmental visualization issues are presented in this case study. Visualization with heterogeneous computer architectures is highlighted in the US EPA Scientific Visualization Center discussion. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center effort to develop the multidimensional analysis of sensor systems (MASS) environment is presented. Florida State University's building of a new scientific visualization package, Sci An, is reported. This is followed by a discussion of the design and implementation of VIS-AD, an experimental laboratory for developing scientific algorithms, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The visualization of global atmospheric data at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center is highlighted.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The relationship between gravity and topography to study subseafloor structures is discussed. Specifically, analysis of the dynamics of seafloor spreading using satellite altimetry is described. The visualization of satellite altimetry data and the limitations of such applications are presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
We discuss a system which provides a single, unified model of oil and gas reservoirs that is used across a range of disciplines from geologists to reservoir engineers. It has to store, manipulate and display reservoir phenomena which are observed over several orders of magnitude from 1 mm to 10 km. We propose that the current capabilities of visualization, over this range of scales, can remove perception barriers that have existed between disciplines and provide clear insights into the problems of modeling reservoirs from geological and engineering perspectives.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visualization of events in high energy physics is an important tool to check hard- and software and to generate pictures for presentation purposes. The radial pattern of all events suggests the use of predefined projections, especially p/Z and Y/X. The representation can be improved by a "fish-eye" transformation and by angular projections, which produce straight track patterns and allow extensive magnifications. Three dimensional data of radial structure are best displayed in the 3D V-Plot, which has optimal track separation and presents all relevant information in a clear way.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Some years ago it was established that the muon catalyzed fusion phenomenon could be used for the production of energy. This fact has been causing a rebirth of interest in the universal methods of solving the quantum Coulomb three-body problem. The adiabatic hyperspherical (AHS) approach considered in this joint project has definite advantages in comparison with other methods. The case study proposed focuses on the study of the structure and behavior of the wave function of bound states of a quantum three-body system as well as of the basis functions of the AHS approach. Adapted scientific visualization tools such as surface rendering, volume ray tracing and texturing will be used. Visualization allows to discover interesting features in the behavior of the basis functions and to analyze the convergence of the AHS-expansion for the wave functions.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses and debates the role played by 3D visualization in medicine as a set of methods and techniques for displaying 3D spatial information related to the anatomy and the physiology of the human body.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors describe a graphical system developed for researchers in materials science for extracting information from data obtained by atomic force microscopy. In particular, they consider the problem of computing surface orientations from data obtained from ceramic materials. The visualization problems they consider in designing this system include finding useful mechanisms for the researcher to interact with the data, presenting results in forms familiar to the scientist, and enhancing traditional display techniques.
The molecular events involved in the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, represent a fundamental biochemical process. These events were selected for animation because the mechanism involves both a ligand-receptor conformational shape change, and an enzyme-substrate conformational shape change. Expository animation brought this biochemical process to life.
Microsatellite genotypes can have problems that are difficult to detect with existing tools. One such problem is null alleles. This paper presents a new visualization tool that helps to find and characterize these errors. The paper explains how the tool is used to analyze groups of genotypes and proposes other possible uses.
For psychophysical studies in spatial cognition a virtual model of the picturesque old town of Tubingen has been constructed. In order to perform psychophysical experiments in highly realistic virtual environments the model is based on high quality texture maps adding up to several hundreds of MBytes. To accomplish the required real-time frame updates, view frustum and occlusion culling without visibility pre-processing, levels of detail, and texture compression are applied in an interleaved manner. Shared memory communication and a standard PC with two commodity graphics cards is used to enable the powerful combination of those techniques because this combination is not yet available on a single graphics card.
As part of a larger effort exploring alternative display systems, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has installed systems in two offices that extend and update the previously described "Office of Real Soon Now" project to improve the value for visualization tasks. These new systems use higher resolution projectors driven by workstations that run Unix-based applications via Linux and support hardware-accelerated 3D graphics, even across the boundary between displays.




We describe a method for processing large amounts of volumetric data collected from a Knife Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). The neuronal data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions that prior volumetric representations have difficulty dealing with efficiently. Since the full volume data set can be extremely large, on-the-fly processing of the data is necessary.

A new multiple resolution volume rendering method for finite element analysis (FEA) data is presented. Our method is composed of three stages: in the first stage, the Gauss points of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the Gauss points are computed. By representing the Gauss points as graph vertices and connecting adjacent Gauss points with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. In the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently, a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a level of detail (LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. In the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices arc sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards. The billboards are then modulated with texture maps to generate the footprints of the vertices. Finally, these footprints are composited to produce the volume rendering image.

Methods of rendering reflections in curved surfaces are examined. A numerical algorithm to derive spherical reflections is presented. This algorithm has many attractive qualities, such as low computation costs, object space coherence, device and resolution independence, and generation of maximum information about reflections in curved surfaces. The authors demonstrate that rendering reflections is a difficult problem, as it defies analytic solutions. The authors indicate several alternatives for generalizing this method to a broader domain.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The authors describe an innovative personal visualization system and its application to several research and engineering problems. The system bridges both hardware and software components to permit a user to graphically describe a visualization problem to the computer; thereby reducing program development time to a few hours. Low-cost visualization is achieved using PC-based software that can either be executed on a PC or drive graphic workstations for high-resolution displays. In either case, supercomputer computation rates are available for the visualization process. On PCs this is done with one or more PiP plug in cards, each of which is capable of 100 million floating point operations per second. On workstations this is done with the QUEN array processor. Applications mentioned include: ocean wave imaging; characterizing superconductors; and solar sail visualization.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Chemical reactions occurring within complex domains, such as fractals, can display behavior which differs radically from the expectation of classical chemical kinetics. Rather than relaxing to a uniform distribution at the steady state, these nonclassical systems display large-scale order on many scales. Such self-organization is difficult to measure using the usual statistical techniques, but is visually apparent. The authors discuss some of the problems of visualizing chemical kinetics in fractal domains and describe evolution of the visualization as the chemist and visualization scientist collaborated.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A low-cost, high-performance visualization tool based on the IBM PC is described. Characteristics of scientific and engineering visualization and requirements for real time analysis are discussed. Application programming without coding by use of flowgraphs is also presented.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This case study is a result of a six-week feasibility exercise, the aim of which was to explore the extend to which existing visualization software can be used for visualizing ISIS neutron scattering data. ISIS is an experimental facility devoted to the use of pulsed neutrons and muons to investigate the microscopic structure and dynamics of all classes of condensed matter. The feasibility study demonstrated the benefits of using visualization in exploring material science data, and also proved that it is possible to satisfy most of the requirements ISIS researchers place on a software environment by using application visualization systems (AVSs), and without writing any new code. The problems encountered and possible solutions are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The package described in this paper has been designed for analyzing the data collected in the LEP experiment ALEPH. Its main graphical feature is a deep interplay between the description of the objects manipulated and their relationships, and their graphical representation. The easy access to information through navigation between objects and its display makes possible a thorough study of the events produced by the detector. This has proved to be very powerful in numerous occasions for analyzing data and testing programs. The package provides as well statistical analysis tools and a graphic editor. It is based on the PHIGS graphics standard. It will develop towards a more elaborate usage of the data structure in particular in the geometrical representations and towards object oriented languages to overcome some heaviness linked to the use of Fortran.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
As part of an inter-disciplinary effort, we are visually exploring a current problem in philosophical logic related to information processing. Given a set of inconsistent sentences or inputs, a processor cannot unambiguously infer any specific consequence. Traces represent subsets of possible consequences which can be inferred classically from partitions of the set of inputs. We are interested in the relationship between a given set of Boolean inputs and its respective trace(s). We have developed a visualization paradigm which allows us to view and explore this relationship effectively.
A general framework for visualization of statistical properties of high-dimensional pattern samples and the related computational steps are introduced. These procedures are exemplified on applications in anthropometrical research (shape information in faces) but can be easily generalized to various other morphometrical questions and data sets with pattern structure, e.g., data stemming from sensor arrays. Presently, the visualization techniques illustrated concentrate on (higher) moments of first order. It is suggested, how moments of second order can be visualized by animations and how this approach can be used in the context of comparative visualization.


This paper examines a series of NASA outreach visualizations created using several layers of remote sensing satellite data ranging from 4-kilometers per pixel to I-meter per pixel. The viewer is taken on a seamless, cloud free journey from a global view of the Earth down to ground level where buildings, streets, and cars are visible. The visualizations were produced using a procedural shader that takes advantage of accurate georegistration and color matching between images. The shader accurately and efficiently maps the data sets to geometry allowing for animations with few perceptual transitions among data sets. We developed a pipeline to facilitate the production of over twenty zoom visualizations. Millions of people have seen these visualizations through national and international media coverage.



Summary form only given. The human visual system is the result of evolution by natural selection and hence its design must incorporate detailed knowledge of the physical properties of the natural environment. This is an obvious statement, but the scientific community has been slow to take it seriously. Only recently has there been an increased effort to directly measure the statistical properties of natural scenes and compare them to the design and performance of the human visual system. This work describes some recent studies of the chromatic and geometrical properties of natural materials and natural images, as well as some perceptual and physiological studies designed to test how those physical properties are related to human perceptual mechanisms.
Although there is a remarkable pace in the advance of computational resources and storage for real-time visualization the immensity of the input data continues to outstrip any advances. The task for interactively visualizing such a massive terrain is to render a triangulated mesh using a view-dependent error tolerance, thus intelligently and perceptually managing the scene’s geometric complexity. At any particular instance in time (i.e. displayed frame), this level-of-detail (LOD) terrain surface consists of a mesh composed of hundreds of thousands of dynamically selected triangles. The triangles are selected using the current time-step’s view parameters and the view-dependent error tolerance. Massive terrain data easily exceeds main memory storage capacity such that out-of-core rendering must be performed. This further complicates the triangle selection and terrain rendering owing to tertiary storage’s relatively poor performance.
Probabilistic graphs are challenging to visualize using the traditional node-link diagram. Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difficult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these findings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated visualizations for probabilistic networks.
Visual Question Answering systems target answering open-ended textual questions given input images. They are a testbed for learning high-level reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state-of-the-art neural models — attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields, machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA, which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.
Data can be visually represented using visual channels like position, length or luminance. An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or ‘wind map’ (angle). With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we show how the rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new probabilistic ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory. These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for reliably ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).
We present Knowledge Rocks, an implementation strategy and guideline for augmenting visualization systems to knowledge-assisted visualization systems, as defined by the KAVA model. Visualization systems become more and more sophisticated. Hence, it is increasingly important to support users with an integrated knowledge base in making constructive choices and drawing the right conclusions. We support the effective reactivation of visualization software resources by augmenting them with knowledge-assistance. To provide a general and yet supportive implementation strategy, we propose an implementation process that bases on an application-agnostic architecture. This architecture is derived from existing knowledge-assisted visualization systems and the KAVA model. Its centerpiece is an ontology that is able to automatically analyze and classify input data, linked to a database to store classified instances. We discuss design decisions and advantages of the KR framework and illustrate its broad area of application in diverse integration possibilities of this architecture into an existing visualization system. In addition, we provide a detailed case study by augmenting an it-security system with knowledge-assistance facilities.
For many households, investing for retirement is one of the most significant decisions and is fraught with uncertainty. In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.
In this paper, we report on a study of visual representations for cyclical data and the effect of interactively <i>wrapping</i> a bar chart ‘around its boundaries’. Compared to linear bar chart, polar (or radial) visualisations have the advantage that cyclical data can be presented continuously without mentally bridging the visual ‘cut’ across the left-and-right boundaries. To investigate this hypothesis and to assess the effect the cut has on analysis performance, this paper presents results from a crowdsourced, controlled experiment with 72 participants comparing new continuous panning technique to linear bar charts (<i>interactive wrapping</i>). Our results show that bar charts with interactive wrapping lead to less errors compared to standard bar charts or polar charts. Inspired by these results, we generalise the concept of interactive wrapping to other visualisations for cyclical or relational data. We describe a design space based on the concept of one-dimensional wrapping and two-dimensional wrapping, linked to two common 3D topologies; cylinder and torus that can be used to metaphorically explain one- and two-dimensional wrapping. This design space suggests that interactive wrapping is widely applicable to many different data types.
Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques can generate 2D projections and enable visual exploration of cluster structures of high-dimensional datasets. However, different DR techniques would yield various patterns, which significantly affect the performance of visual cluster analysis tasks. We present the results of a user study that investigates the influence of different DR techniques on visual cluster analysis. Our study focuses on the most concerned property types, namely the linearity and locality, and evaluates twelve representative DR techniques that cover the concerned properties. Four controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate how the DR techniques facilitate the tasks of 1) cluster identification, 2) membership identification, 3) distance comparison, and 4) density comparison, respectively. We also evaluated users' subjective preference of the DR techniques regarding the quality of projected clusters. The results show that: 1) Non-linear and Local techniques are preferred in cluster identification and membership identification; 2) Linear techniques perform better than non-linear techniques in density comparison; 3) UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) perform the best in cluster identification and membership identification; 4) NMF (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) has competitive performance in distance comparison; 5) t-SNLE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Linear Embedding) has competitive performance in density comparison.
Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing <i>layered</i> layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a <i>layout optimization model</i> that prioritizes <i>optimality</i> - as compared to <i>scalability</i> - because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing S<small>tratisfimal</small> L<small>ayout</small>, a <i>modular integer-linear-programming formulation</i> that can consider several important readability criteria <i>simultaneously</i> — crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that we believe cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices. A full version of this paper with all appendices, data, and source code is available at osf.io/qdyt9 with live examples at <uri>https://visdunneright.github.io/stratisfimal/</uri>.
N-ary relationships, which relate $N$ entities where $N$ is not necessarily two, can be visually represented as polygons whose vertices are the entities of the relationships. Manually generating a high-quality layout using this representation is labor-intensive. In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views. We apply our visualization approach to a number of datasets that include co-authorship data and social contact pattern data.
Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to <i>jam session</i>, while more structured presentations can range from <i>semi-improvisational performances</i> among peers to formal <i>recitals</i> given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences.
In this paper, we propose F2-Bubbles, a set overlay visualization technique that addresses overlapping artifacts and supports interactive editing with intelligent suggestions. The core of our method is a new, efficient set overlay construction algorithm that approximates the optimal set overlay by considering set elements and their non-set neighbors. Thanks to the efficiency of the algorithm, interactive editing is achieved, and with intelligent suggestions, users can easily and flexibly edit visualizations through direct manipulations with local adaptations. A quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art set visualization techniques and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggests that F2-Bubbles is a helpful technique for set visualization.
Visual query of spatiotemporal data is becoming an increasingly important function in visual analytics applications. Various works have been presented for querying large spatiotemporal data in real time. However, the real-time query of spatiotemporal data distribution is still an open challenge. As spatiotemporal data become larger, methods of aggregation, storage and querying become critical. We propose a new visual query system that creates a low-memory storage component and provides real-time visual interactions of spatiotemporal data. We first present a peak-based kernel density estimation method to produce the data distribution for the spatiotemporal data. Then a novel density dictionary learning approach is proposed to compress temporal density maps and accelerate the query calculation. Moreover, various intuitive query interactions are presented to interactively gain patterns. The experimental results obtained on three datasets demonstrate that the presented system offers an effective query for visual analytics of spatiotemporal data.
We present Joint t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Joint t-SNE), a technique to generate comparable projections of multiple high-dimensional datasets. Although t-SNE has been widely employed to visualize high-dimensional datasets from various domains, it is limited to projecting a single dataset. When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation. We also showcase a real-world use case to visualize and compare the activation of different layers of a neural network.
Which drug is most promising for a cancer patient? A new microscopy-based approach for measuring the mass of individual cancer cells treated with different drugs promises to answer this question in only a few hours. However, the analysis pipeline for extracting data from these images is still far from complete automation: human intervention is necessary for quality control for preprocessing steps such as segmentation, adjusting filters, removing noise, and analyzing the result. To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach for choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient.
We present a differentiable volume rendering solution that provides differentiability of all continuous parameters of the volume rendering process. This differentiable renderer is used to steer the parameters towards a setting with an optimal solution of a problem-specific objective function. We have tailored the approach to volume rendering by enforcing a constant memory footprint via analytic inversion of the blending functions. This makes it independent of the number of sampling steps through the volume and facilitates the consideration of small-scale changes. The approach forms the basis for automatic optimizations regarding external parameters of the rendering process and the volumetric density field itself. We demonstrate its use for automatic viewpoint selection using differentiable entropy as objective, and for optimizing a transfer function from rendered images of a given volume. Optimization of per-voxel densities is addressed in two different ways: First, we mimic inverse tomography and optimize a 3D density field from images using an absorption model. This simplification enables comparisons with algebraic reconstruction techniques and state-of-the-art differentiable path tracers. Second, we introduce a novel approach for tomographic reconstruction from images using an emission-absorption model with post-shading via an arbitrary transfer function.
Natural language descriptions sometimes accompany visualizations to better communicate and contextualize their insights, and to improve their accessibility for readers with disabilities. However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.
Undirected graphs are frequently used to model phenomena that deal with interacting objects, such as social networks, brain activity and communication networks. The topology of an undirected graph <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$G$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-1-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula> can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization crucially depends on the <i>ordering</i> of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice. <p>Often, graphs do not exist in isolation but as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of vertices, for example, brain scans over time or of different people. To visualize such graph collections, we need a <i>single</i> ordering that works well for all matrices <i>simultaneously</i>. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a <i>collection-aware</i> approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.</p> <p>The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use <i>Moran's</i> <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$I$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-2-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of established patterns. Moran's <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$I$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-3-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula> refines previously proposed stress measures. Furthermore, the popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a similar measure which further supports the use of Moran's <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$I$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-4-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in this context. An ordering that maximizes Moran's <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$I$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-5-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula> can be computed via solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP); orderings that approximate the optimal ordering can be computed more efficiently, using any of the approximation algorithms for metric TSP.</p> <p>We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$I$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-beusekom-3114773-eqinline-6-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as the quality metric. Our results show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection.

Our collection-aware implementations carry no significant additional computational costs.</p>
Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid.
Data stories often seek to elicit affective feelings from viewers. However, how to design affective data stories remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate one specific design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express five positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.
Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.
Complex, high-dimensional data is used in a wide range of domains to explore problems and make decisions. Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes <i>counterfactual subsets</i> to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.
People's associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered “non-colorable” (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.
Video moderation, which refers to remove deviant or explicit content from e-commerce livestreams, has become prevalent owing to social and engaging features. However, this task is tedious and time consuming due to the difficulties associated with watching and reviewing multimodal video content, including video frames and audio clips. To ensure effective video moderation, we propose VideoModerator, a risk-aware framework that seamlessly integrates human knowledge with machine insights. This framework incorporates a set of advanced machine learning models to extract the risk-aware features from multimodal video content and discover potentially deviant videos. Moreover, this framework introduces an interactive visualization interface with three views, namely, a video view, a frame view, and an audio view. In the video view, we adopt a segmented timeline and highlight high-risk periods that may contain deviant information. In the frame view, we present a novel visual summarization method that combines risk-aware features and video context to enable quick video navigation. In the audio view, we employ a storyline-based design to provide a multi-faceted overview which can be used to explore audio content. Furthermore, we report the usage of VideoModerator through a case scenario and conduct experiments and a controlled user study to validate its effectiveness.
Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation.
Scatterplots can encode a third dimension by using additional channels like size or color (e.g. bubble charts). We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the <i>weighted average illusion</i>, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer's choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misjudgments like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.
We present an approach utilizing Topological Data Analysis to study the structure of face poses used in affective computing, i.e., the process of recognizing human emotion. The approach uses a conditional comparison of different emotions, both respective and irrespective of time, with multiple topological distance metrics, dimension reduction techniques, and face subsections (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth, etc.). The results confirm that our topology-based approach captures known patterns, distinctions between emotions, and distinctions between individuals, which is an important step towards more robust and explainable emotion recognition by machines.
Inspection of tissues using a light microscope is the primary method of diagnosing many diseases, notably cancer. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling the collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with the design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10<sup>9</sup> or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing regions of interest (ROIs) in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope-to-screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.
We present an exploratory analysis of gender representation among the authors, committee members, and award winners at the IEEE Visualization (VIS) conference over the last 30 years. Our goal is to provide descriptive data on which diversity discussions and efforts in the community can build. We look in particular at the gender of VIS authors as a proxy for the community at large. We consider measures of overall gender representation among authors, differences in careers, positions in author lists, and collaborations. We found that the proportion of female authors has increased from 9% in the first five years to 22% in the last five years of the conference. Over the years, we found the same representation of women in program committees and slightly more women in organizing committees. Women are less likely to appear in the last author position, but more in the middle positions. In terms of collaboration patterns, female authors tend to collaborate more than expected with other women in the community. All non-gender related data is available on https://osf.io/ydfj4/ and the gender-author matching can be accessed through https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1301.
Achieving high rendering quality in the visualization of large particle data, for example from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, requires a significant amount of sub-pixel super-sampling, due to very high numbers of particles per pixel. Although it is impossible to super-sample all particles of large-scale data at interactive rates, efficient occlusion culling can decouple the overall data size from a high effective sampling rate of visible particles. However, while the latter is essential for domain scientists to be able to see important data features, performing occlusion culling by sampling or sorting the data is usually slow or error-prone due to visibility estimates of insufficient quality. We present a novel probabilistic culling architecture for super-sampled high-quality rendering of large particle data. Occlusion is dynamically determined at the sub-pixel level, without explicit visibility sorting or data simplification. We introduce confidence maps to probabilistically estimate confidence in the visibility data gathered so far. This enables progressive, confidence-based culling, helping to avoid wrong visibility decisions. In this way, we determine particle visibility with high accuracy, although only a small part of the data set is sampled. This enables extensive super-sampling of (partially) visible particles for high rendering quality, at a fraction of the cost of sampling all particles. For real-time performance with millions of particles, we exploit novel features of recent GPU architectures to group particles into two hierarchy levels, combining fine-grained culling with high frame rates.
What makes speeches effective has long been a subject for debate, and until today there is broad controversy among public speaking experts about what factors make a speech effective as well as the roles of these factors in speeches. Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis methods to help understand effective speaking strategies. In this paper, we propose E-ffective, a visual analytic system allowing speaking experts and novices to analyze both the role of speech factors and their contribution in effective speeches. From interviews with domain experts and investigating existing literature, we identified important factors to consider in inspirational speeches. We obtained the generated factors from multi-modal data that were then related to effectiveness data. Our system supports rapid understanding of critical factors in inspirational speeches, including the influence of emotions by means of novel visualization methods and interaction. Two novel visualizations include E-spiral (that shows the emotional shifts in speeches in a visually compact way) and E-script (that connects speech content with key speech delivery information). In our evaluation we studied the influence of our system on experts' domain knowledge about speech factors. We further studied the usability of the system by speaking novices and experts on assisting analysis of inspirational speech effectiveness.
How to achieve academic career success has been a long-standing research question in social science research. With the growing availability of large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories, scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We propose <i>ACSeeker</i>, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of <i>ACSeeker</i>, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.
We introduce Diatoms, a technique that generates design inspiration for glyphs by sampling from palettes of mark shapes, encoding channels, and glyph scaffold shapes. Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar <i>small multiples</i> configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a <i>small permutables</i> design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers' reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.
Zero-shot classification is a promising paradigm to solve an applicable problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.
Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels. However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2 Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2 Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover, M2 Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal models for sentiment analysis.
Edge bundling techniques cluster edges with similar attributes (i.e. similarity in direction and proximity) together to reduce the visual clutter. All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of Edge-Path bundling over other techniques.
Interactive visualization design and research have primarily focused on local data and synchronous events. However, for more complex use cases-e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources-developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. As in many declarative languages, DIEL developers specify only what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it. Uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions, server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a visualization at any time, developers write declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and automatically generates necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL'S performance and expressivity through example interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL'S usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.
In this design study, we present IRVINE, a Visual Analytics (VA) system, which facilitates the analysis of acoustic data to detect and understand previously unknown errors in the manufacturing of electrical engines. In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.
Personal informatics research helps people track personal data for the purposes of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge. This field, however, has predominantly focused on the data collection and insight-generation elements of self-tracking, with less attention paid to flexible data analysis. As a result, this inattention has led to inflexible analytic pipelines that do not reflect or support the diverse ways people want to engage with their data. This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people engaging with and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, what we call the personal informatics analysis gap. We explore this gap through a multistage longitudinal study on how asthmatics engage with personal air quality data, and we report how participants: were motivated by broad and diverse goals; exhibited patterns in the way they explored their data; engaged with their data in playful ways; discovered new insights through serendipitous exploration; and were reluctant to use analysis tools on their own. These results present new opportunities for visual analysis research and suggest the need for fundamental shifts in how and what we design when supporting personal data analysis.
Breaking news and first-hand reports often trend on social media platforms before traditional news outlets cover them. The real-time analysis of posts on such platforms can reveal valuable and timely insights for journalists, politicians, business analysts, and first responders, but the high number and diversity of new posts pose a challenge. In this work, we present an interactive system that enables the visual analysis of streaming social media data on a large scale in real-time. We propose an efficient and explainable dynamic clustering algorithm that powers a continuously updated visualization of the current thematic landscape as well as detailed visual summaries of specific topics of interest. Our parallel clustering strategy provides an adaptive stream with a digestible but diverse selection of recent posts related to relevant topics. We also integrate familiar visual metaphors that are highly interlinked for enabling both explorative and more focused monitoring tasks. Analysts can gradually increase the resolution to dive deeper into particular topics. In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated posts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events. We evaluated our dynamic clustering algorithm and discuss several use cases that show the utility of our system.
Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been heavily used in visual analysis tools for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them from a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.
Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.
As uncertainty visualizations for general audiences become increasingly common, designers must understand the full impact of uncertainty communication techniques on viewers' decision processes. Prior work demonstrates mixed performance outcomes with respect to how individuals make decisions using various visual and textual depictions of uncertainty. Part of the inconsistency across findings may be due to an over-reliance on task accuracy, which cannot, on its own, provide a comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty visualization techniques support reasoning processes. In this work, we advance the debate surrounding the efficacy of modern 1D uncertainty visualizations by conducting converging quantitative and qualitative analyses of both the effort and strategies used by individuals when provided with quantile dotplots, density plots, interval plots, mean plots, and textual descriptions of uncertainty. We utilize two approaches for examining effort across uncertainty communication techniques: a measure of individual differences in working-memory capacity known as an operation span (OSPAN) task and self-reports of perceived workload via the NASA-TLX. The results reveal that both visualization methods and working-memory capacity impact participants' decisions. Specifically, quantile dotplots and density plots (i.e., distributional annotations) result in more accurate judgments than interval plots, textual descriptions of uncertainty, and mean plots (i.e., summary annotations). Additionally, participants' open-ended responses suggest that individuals viewing distributional annotations are more likely to employ a strategy that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into their judgments than those viewing summary annotations. When comparing quantile dotplots to density plots, this work finds that both methods are equally effective for low-working-memory individuals. However, for individuals with high-working-memory capacity, quantile dotplots evoke more accurate responses with less perceived effort. Given these results, we advocate for the inclusion of converging behavioral and subjective workload metrics in addition to accuracy performance to further disambiguate meaningful differences among visualization techniques.
Despite the rising popularity of automated visualization tools, existing systems tend to provide direct results which do not always fit the input data or meet visualization requirements. Therefore, additional specification adjustments are still required in real-world use cases. However, manual adjustments are difficult since most users do not necessarily possess adequate skills or visualization knowledge. Even experienced users might create imperfect visualizations that involve chart construction errors. We present a framework, VizLinter, to help users detect flaws and rectify already-built but defective visualizations. The framework consists of two components, (1) a visualization linter, which applies well-recognized principles to inspect the legitimacy of rendered visualizations, and (2) a visualization fixer, which automatically corrects the detected violations according to the linter. We implement the framework into an online editor prototype based on Vega-Lite specifications. To further evaluate the system, we conduct an in-lab user study. The results prove its effectiveness and efficiency in identifying and fixing errors for data visualizations.
Problem-driven visualization work is rooted in deeply understanding the data, actors, processes, and workflows of a target domain. However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions for specificity in visualization design: <i>Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive abilities?</i> This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex visualizations (isocontour plots and scatterplots), but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific visualization with specific recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.
Visualizing data in sports videos is gaining traction in sports analytics, given its ability to communicate insights and explicate player strategies engagingly. However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level <i>(what the constituents are)</i> and clip-level <i>(how those constituents are organized)</i>. We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by <i>selecting the data</i> to visualize instead of manually <i>drawing the graphical marks</i>. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports <i>(e.g</i>., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities.
Finding the similarities and differences between groups of datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. This paper presents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive visualization interface facilitates interpretation and refinement of the ULCA results. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.
3D asymmetric tensor fields have found many applications in science and engineering domains, such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. 3D asymmetric tensors can have complex eigenvalues, which makes their analysis and visualization more challenging than 3D symmetric tensors. Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.
Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.
Despite the ubiquity of communicative visualizations, specifying communicative intent during design is ad hoc. Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as important energy sources for mobile phones, electric vehicles, and drones. Experts have attempted to replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes that have wider electrochemical window and higher stability due to the potential safety risks, such as electrolyte leakage, flammable solvents, poor thermal stability, and many side reactions caused by liquid electrolytes. However, finding suitable alternative materials using traditional approaches is very difficult due to the incredibly high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML)-based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. However, learning tools designed for domain experts to conduct intuitive performance comparison and analysis of ML models are rare. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models and understand and explore the predication results comprehensively. Our system uses a multifaceted visualization scheme designed to support analysis from various perspectives, such as feature distribution, data similarity, model performance, and result presentation. Case studies with actual lab experiments have been conducted by the experts, and the final results confirmed the effectiveness and helpfulness of our system.
It has been widely suggested that a key goal of visualization systems is to assist decision making, but is this true? We conduct a critical investigation on whether the activity of decision making is indeed central to the visualization domain. By approaching decision making as a user <i>task</i>, we explore the degree to which decision tasks are evident in visualization research and user studies. Our analysis suggests that decision tasks are not commonly found in current visualization task taxonomies and that the visualization field has yet to leverage guidance from decision theory domains on how to study such tasks. We further found that the majority of visualizations addressing decision making were not evaluated based on their ability to assist decision tasks. Finally, to help expand the impact of visual analytics in organizational as well as casual decision making activities, we initiate a research agenda on how decision making assistance could be elevated throughout visualization research.
Although we have seen a proliferation of algorithms for recommending visualizations, these algorithms are rarely compared with one another, making it difficult to ascertain which algorithm is best for a given visual analysis scenario. Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an <i>evaluation</i> perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.
We present STNet, an end-to-end generative framework that synthesizes spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes with high fidelity for time-varying data. STNet includes two modules: a generator and a spatiotemporal discriminator. The input to the generator is two low-resolution volumes at both ends, and the output is the intermediate and the two-ending spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes. The spatiotemporal discriminator, leveraging convolutional long short-term memory, accepts a spatiotemporal super-resolution sequence as input and predicts a conditional score for each volume based on its spatial (the volume itself) and temporal (the previous volumes) information. We propose an unsupervised pre-training stage using cycle loss to improve the generalization of STNet. Once trained, STNet can generate spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes from low-resolution ones, offering scientists an option to save data storage (i.e., sparsely sampling the simulation output in both spatial and temporal dimensions). We compare STNet with the baseline bicubic+linear interpolation, two deep learning solutions (<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mathsf{SSR}+\mathsf{TSF}$</tex-math><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="28tvcg01-han-3114815-eqinline-1-small.tif" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, STD), and a state-of-the-art tensor compression solution (TTHRESH) to show the effectiveness of STNet.
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) has become a standard for exploratory data analysis, as it is capable of revealing clusters even in complex data while requiring minimal user input. While its run-time complexity limited it to small datasets in the past, recent efforts improved upon the expensive similarity computations and the previously quadratic minimization. Nevertheless, t-SNE still has high runtime and memory costs when operating on millions of points. We present a novel method for executing the t-SNE minimization. While our method overall retains a linear runtime complexity, we obtain a significant performance increase in the most expensive part of the minimization. We achieve a significant improvement without a noticeable decrease in accuracy even when targeting a 3D embedding. Our method constructs a pair of spatial hierarchies over the embedding, which are simultaneously traversed to approximate many N-body interactions at once. We demonstrate an efficient GPGPU implementation and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets.
Administrative justice concerns the relationships between individuals and the state. It includes redress and complaints on decisions of a child's education, social care, licensing, planning, environment, housing and homelessness. However, if someone has a complaint or an issue, it is challenging for people to understand different possible redress paths and explore what path is suitable for their situation. Explanatory visualisation has the potential to display these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see, understand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further complicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance and policies and requires judicial interpretation. Consequently, there is not a single database of paths of redress. In this work we present how we have co-designed a system to visualise administrative justice paths of redress. Simultaneously, we classify, collate and organise the underpinning data, from expert workshops, heuristic evaluation and expert critical reflection. We make four contributions: (i) an application design study of the explanatory visualisation tool (Artemus), (ii) coordinated and co-design approach to aggregating the data, (iii) two in-depth case studies in housing and education demonstrating explanatory paths of redress in administrative law, and (iv) reflections on the expert co-design process and expert data gathering and explanatory visualisation for administrative justice and law.
In the study of packed granular materials, the performance of a sample (e.g., the detonation of a high-energy explosive) often correlates to measurements of a fluid flowing through it. The “effective surface area,” the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them is computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.
There are a few prominent practices for conducting reviews of academic literature, including searching for specific keywords on Google Scholar or checking citations from some initial seed paper(s). These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.
We present a visual analytics tool, MiningVis, to explore the long-term historical evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that attracts much attention but remains difficult to understand. Particularly important to the success, stability, and security of Bitcoin is a component of the system called “mining.” Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior. Each of these features can be compared to external data concerning pool characteristics and Bitcoin news. In order to assess the value of MiningVis, we conducted online interviews and insight-based user studies with Bitcoin miners. We describe research questions tackled and insights made by our participants and illustrate practical implications for visual analytics systems for Bitcoin mining.
Reviewing a think-aloud video is both time-consuming and demanding as it requires UX (user experience) professionals to attend to many behavioral signals of the user in the video. Moreover, challenges arise when multiple UX professionals need to collaborate to reduce bias and errors. We propose a collaborative visual analytics tool, CoUX, to facilitate UX evaluators collectively reviewing think-aloud usability test videos of digital interfaces. CoUX seamlessly supports usability problem identification, annotation, and discussion in an integrated environment. To ease the discovery of usability problems, CoUX visualizes a set of problem-indicators based on acoustic, textual, and visual features extracted from the video and audio of a think-aloud session with machine learning. CoUX further enables collaboration amongst UX evaluators for logging, commenting, and consolidating the discovered problems with a chatbox-like user interface. We designed CoUX based on a formative study with two UX experts and insights derived from the literature. We conducted a user study with six pairs of UX practitioners on collaborative think-aloud video analysis tasks. The results indicate that CoUX is useful and effective in facilitating both problem identification and collaborative teamwork. We provide insights into how different features of CoUX were used to support both independent analysis and collaboration. Furthermore, our work highlights opportunities to improve collaborative usability test video analysis.
Well-designed data visualizations can lead to more powerful and intuitive processing by a viewer. To help a viewer intuitively compare values to quickly generate key takeaways, visualization designers can manipulate how data values are arranged in a chart to afford particular comparisons. Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings. These results provide concrete guidelines for how both human designers and automatic chart recommendation systems can make visualizations that help viewers extract the “right” takeaway.
Analysts often make visual causal inferences about possible data-generating models. However, visual analytics (VA) software tends to leave these models implicit in the mind of the analyst, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of informal visual “insights”. We formally evaluate the quality of causal inferences from visualizations by adopting <i>causal support</i>—a Bayesian cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations given some data—as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users' causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.
We contribute a deep-learning-based method that assists in designing analytical dashboards for analyzing a data table. Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner. We compare our deep learning model with existing methods for visualization recommendation and conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the system.
Visual data analysis tools provide people with the agency and flexibility to explore data using a variety of interactive functionalities. However, this flexibility may introduce potential consequences in situations where users unknowingly overemphasize or underemphasize specific subsets of the data or attribute space they are analyzing. For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.
In the process of developing an infrastructure for providing visualization and visual analytics (VIS) tools to epidemiologists and modeling scientists, we encountered a technical challenge for applying a number of visual designs to numerous datasets rapidly and reliably with limited development resources. In this paper, we present a technical solution to address this challenge. Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-design user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment. This technical solution has been used in the development of the RAMPVIS infrastructure for supporting a consortium of epidemiologists and modeling scientists through visualization.
For all its potential in supporting data analysis, particularly in exploratory situations, visualization also creates barriers: accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals. Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&amp;M experts—all of them blind—to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible—using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses—sound and touch—to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.
Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets — the quintessential table tool — remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for <i>data workers</i> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">[61]</xref>, people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and “get their hands on” the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.
Event sequence mining is often used to summarize patterns from hundreds of sequences but faces special challenges when handling racket sports data. In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent's reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively. Based on the mined results, we propose a glyph-based Sankey diagram to visualize the ever-changing tactic progression and support interactive data exploration. Through two case studies with four domain experts in tennis and badminton, we demonstrate that our system can effectively obtain insights about tactic progression in most racket sports. We further discuss the strengths and the limitations of our system based on domain experts' feedback.
We propose Steadiness and Cohesiveness, two novel metrics to measure the inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.
Creating comprehensible visualizations of highly overlapping set-typed data is a challenging task due to its complexity. To facilitate insights into set connectivity and to leverage semantic relations between intersections, we propose a fast two-step layout technique for Euler diagrams that are both well-matched and well-formed. Our method conforms to established form guidelines for Euler diagrams regarding semantics, aesthetics, and readability. First, we establish an initial ordering of the data, which we then use to incrementally create a planar, connected, and monotone dual graph representation. In the next step, the graph is transformed into a circular layout that maintains the semantics and yields simple Euler diagrams with smooth curves. When the data cannot be represented by simple diagrams, our algorithm always falls back to a solution that is not well-formed but still well-matched, whereas previous methods often fail to produce expected results. We show the usefulness of our method for visualizing set-typed data using examples from text analysis and infographics. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of our approach and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art methods.
Situated visualization is an emerging concept within visualization, in which data is visualized in situ, where it is relevant to people. The concept has gained interest from multiple research communities, including visualization, human-computer interaction (HCI) and augmented reality. This has led to a range of explorations and applications of the concept, however, this early work has focused on the operational aspect of situatedness leading to inconsistent adoption of the concept and terminology. First, we contribute a literature survey in which we analyze 44 papers that explicitly use the term “situated visualization” to provide an overview of the research area, how it defines situated visualization, common application areas and technology used, as well as type of data and type of visualizations. Our survey shows that research on situated visualization has focused on technology-centric approaches that foreground a spatial understanding of situatedness. Secondly, we contribute five perspectives on situatedness (space, time, place, activity, and community) that together expand on the prevalent notion of situatedness in the corpus. We draw from six case studies and prior theoretical developments in HCI. Each perspective develops a generative way of looking at and working with situatedness in design and research. We outline future directions, including considering technology, material and aesthetics, leveraging the perspectives for design, and methods for stronger engagement with target audiences. We conclude with opportunities to consolidate situated visualization research.
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to solve clinical prediction tasks. Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that <i>connect the dots</i> between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions. We further derived a list of design implications for developing future explainable ML tools to support clinical decision-making.
The interpretation of deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a key topic as more and more people apply them to solve various problems and making critical decisions. Concept-based explanations have recently become a popular approach for post-hoc interpretation of DNNs. However, identifying human-understandable visual concepts that affect model decisions is a challenging task that is not easily addressed with automatic approaches. We present a novel human-in-the-Ioop approach to generate user-defined concepts for model interpretation and diagnostics. Central to our proposal is the use of active learning, where human knowledge and feedback are combined to train a concept extractor with very little human labeling effort. We integrate this process into an interactive system, ConceptExtract. Through two case studies, we show how our approach helps analyze model behavior and extract human-friendly concepts for different machine learning tasks and datasets and how to use these concepts to understand the predictions, compare model performance and make suggestions for model refinement. Quantitative experiments show that our active learning approach can accurately extract meaningful visual concepts. More importantly, by identifying visual concepts that negatively affect model performance, we develop the corresponding data augmentation strategy that consistently improves model performance.
This paper presents a unified computational framework for the estimation of distances, geodesics and barycenters of merge trees. We extend recent work on the edit distance [104] and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is strictly equivalent to the $L$2-Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks [110] for geodesics and barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach - with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples - as well as its qualitative ability to generate representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of interest found in the ensemble. We show the utility of our contributions with dedicated visualization applications: feature tracking, temporal reduction and ensemble clustering. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.
A growing number of longitudinal cohort studies are generating data with extensive patient observations across multiple timepoints. Such data offers promising opportunities to better understand the progression of diseases. However, these observations are usually treated as general events in existing visual analysis tools. As a result, their capabilities in modeling disease progression are not fully utilized. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented ThreadStates, an interactive visual analytics tool for the exploration of longitudinal patient cohort data. The focus of ThreadStates is to identify the states of disease progression by learning from observation data in a human-in-the-loop manner. We propose a novel Glyph Matrix design and combine it with a scatter plot to enable seamless identification, observation, and refinement of states. The disease progression patterns are then revealed in terms of state transitions using Sankey-based visualizations. We employ sequence clustering techniques to find patient groups with distinctive progression patterns, and to reveal the association between disease progression and patient-level features. The design and development were driven by a requirement analysis and iteratively refined based on feedback from domain experts over the course of a 10-month design study. Case studies and expert interviews demonstrate that ThreadStates can successively summarize disease states, reveal disease progression, and compare patient groups.
Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or Power Bl, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles. Result snippets, compact previews of these bundles, are presented to users to help them identify relevant content when browsing collections. Our engagement with Tableau product teams and review of existing snippet designs on five platforms showed us that current practices fail to help people judge the relevance of bundles because they include only the title and one image. Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen keywords. We also reflect on the method of visual inspection through random sampling to gain confidence in model and parameter choices.
In many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions. In these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. We reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings.
We explore how the lens of fictional superpowers can help characterize how visualizations empower people and provide inspiration for new visualization systems. Researchers and practitioners often tout visualizations' ability to “make the invisible visible” and to “enhance cognitive abilities.” Meanwhile superhero comics and other modern fiction often depict characters with similarly fantastic abilities that allow them to see and interpret the world in ways that transcend traditional human perception. We investigate the intersection of these domains, and show how the language of superpowers can be used to characterize existing visualization systems and suggest opportunities for new and empowering ones. We introduce two frameworks: The first characterizes seven underlying mechanisms that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed in fiction. The second identifies seven ways in which visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these observations, we illustrate a diverse set of “visualization superpowers” and highlight opportunities for the visualization community to create new systems and interactions that empower new experiences with data Material and illustrations are available under CC-BY 4.0 at osf.io/8yhfz.
Table2Text systems generate textual output based on structured data utilizing machine learning. These systems are essential for fluent natural language interfaces in tools such as virtual assistants; however, left to generate freely these ML systems often produce misleading or unexpected outputs. GenNI (Generation Negotiation Interface) is an interactive visual system for high-level human-AI collaboration in producing descriptive text. The tool utilizes a deep learning model designed with explicit control states. These controls allow users to globally constrain model generations, without sacrificing the representation power of the deep learning models. The visual interface makes it possible for users to interact with AI systems following a Refine-Forecast paradigm to ensure that the generation system acts in a manner human users find suitable. We report multiple use cases on two experiments that improve over uncontrolled generation approaches, while at the same time providing fine-grained control. A demo and source code are available at https://genni.vizhub.ai.
Alternative text is critical in communicating graphics to people who are blind or have low vision. Especially for graphics that contain rich information, such as visualizations, poorly written or an absence of alternative texts can worsen the information access inequality for people with visual impairments. In this work, we consolidate existing guidelines and survey current practices to inspect to what extent current practices and recommendations are aligned. Then, to gain more insight into what people want in visualization alternative texts, we interviewed 22 people with visual impairments regarding their experience with visualizations and their information needs in alternative texts. The study findings suggest that participants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head while listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks (e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would. The study also provides ample support for the need to reference the underlying data instead of visual elements to reduce users' cognitive burden. Informed by the study, we provide a set of recommendations to compose an informative alternative text.
Supporting the translation from natural language (NL) query to visualization (NL2VIS) can simplify the creation of data visualizations because if successful, anyone can generate visualizations by their natural language from the tabular data. The state-of-the-art NL2VIS approaches (<i>e.g.</i>, NL4DV and FlowSense) are based on semantic parsers and heuristic algorithms, which are not end-to-end and are not designed for supporting (possibly) complex data transformations. Deep neural network powered neural machine translation models have made great strides in many machine translation tasks, which suggests that they might be viable for NL2VIS as well. In this paper, we present <b>ncNet</b>, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for supporting NL2VIS, with several novel visualization-aware optimizations, including using attention-forcing to optimize the learning process, and visualization-aware rendering to produce better visualization results. To enhance the capability of machine to comprehend natural language queries, <b>ncNet</b> is also designed to take an optional chart template (<i>e.g.</i>, a pie chart or a scatter plot) as an additional input, where the chart template will be served as a constraint to limit what could be visualized. We conducted both quantitative evaluation and user study, showing that <b>ncNet</b> achieves good accuracy in the <b>nvBench</b> benchmark and is easy-to-use.
This paper investigates how to make data comics interactive. Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.
Graph mining is an essential component of recommender systems and search engines. Outputs of graph mining models typically provide a ranked list sorted by each item's relevance or utility. However, recent research has identified issues of algorithmic bias in such models, and new graph mining algorithms have been proposed to correct for bias. As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms. We support both group and individual fairness levels of comparison. Our framework is designed to enable model developers to compare multi-class fairness between algorithms (for example, comparing PageRank with a debiased PageRank algorithm) to assess the impacts of algorithmic debiasing with respect to group and individual fairness. We demonstrate our framework through two usage scenarios inspecting algorithmic fairness.
Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present <i>COVID-view</i>, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. <i>COVID-view</i> incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using <i>COVID-view</i> and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated <i>COVID-view</i> through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.
Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have made great progress in learning autonomous driving models from large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets. They are trained to predict instantaneous driving behaviors from video data captured by on-vehicle cameras. In this paper, we develop a geo-context aware visualization system for the study of Autonomous Driving Model (ADM) predictions together with large-scale ADM video data. The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geospatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving. Use cases and domain expert evaluation show the utility and effectiveness of the visualization system.
Labels, short textual annotations are an important component of data visualizations, illustrations, infographics, and geographical maps. In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself. In other words, the labeling method should provide the result as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a greedy point-feature labeling method running on GPU. In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image. Our measurements indicate that the proposed method is able to position more labels than existing greedy methods that do not evaluate conflicts between the label candidates. At the same time, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in performance. The increase in performance is mainly due to the parallelization and the efficient evaluation of label candidates.
Semantic segmentation is a critical component in autonomous driving and has to be thoroughly evaluated due to safety concerns. Deep neural network (DNN) based semantic segmentation models are widely used in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to evaluate DNN-based models due to their black-box-like nature, and it is even more difficult to assess model performance for crucial objects, such as lost cargos and pedestrians, in autonomous driving applications. In this work, we propose <i>VASS</i>, a <i><u>V</u></i>isual <i><u>A</u></i>nalytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of <i><u>S</u></i>emantic <i><u>S</u></i>egmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models' performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models' spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of <i>VASS</i> via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models' performance with actionable insights obtained from <i>VASS</i>.
Infographic bar charts have been widely adopted for communicating numerical information because of their attractiveness and memorability. However, these infographics are often created manually with general tools, such as PowerPoint and Adobe Illustrator, and merely composed of primitive visual elements, such as text blocks and shapes. With the absence of chart models, updating or reusing these infographics requires tedious and error-prone manual edits. In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative approach to mitigate this pain point. On one hand, machines are adopted to perform precise and trivial operations, such as mapping numerical values to shape attributes and aligning shapes. On the other hand, we rely on humans to perform subjective and creative tasks, such as changing embellishments or approving the edits made by machines. We encapsulate our technique in a PowerPoint add-in prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness by applying our technique on a diverse set of infographic bar chart examples.
Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure to model processes and relations in a wide range of domains. Examples include control-flow graphs in programs and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns in graphs is an important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode a graph as fixed-length latent vector representation, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondences in the matching results that are crucial for visualization and interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100× speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness for both usage scenarios.
Existing research on making sense of deep neural networks often focuses on neuron-level interpretation, which may not adequately capture the bigger picture of how concepts are collectively encoded by multiple neurons. We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The Neurocartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.
Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is “aligned” with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.
Tactic analysis is a major issue in badminton as the effective usage of tactics is the key to win. The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result. The effectiveness and usefulness of TIVEE are demonstrated by case studies and an expert interview.
Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental “shortcuts”). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.
Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective data visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data visualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
Machine learning (ML) is being applied to a diverse and ever-growing set of domains. In many cases, domain experts - who often have no expertise in ML or data science - are asked to use ML predictions to make high-stakes decisions. Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we implemented and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback was collected, from which we composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers who aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.
Time-series data-usually presented in the form of lines-plays an important role in many domains such as finance, meteorology, health, and urban informatics. Yet, little has been done to support interactive exploration of large-scale time-series data, which requires a clutter-free visual representation with low-latency interactions. In this paper, we contribute a novel line-segment-based KD-tree method to enable interactive analysis of many time series. Our method enables not only fast queries over time series in selected regions of interest but also a line splatting method for efficient computation of the density field and selection of representative lines. Further, we develop KD-Box, an interactive system that provides rich interactions, e.g., timebox, attribute filtering, and coordinated multiple views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-Box in supporting efficient line query and density field computation through a quantitative comparison and show its usefulness for interactive visual analysis on several real-world datasets.
Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our H<small>yper</small>V<small>is</small> tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within H<small>yper</small>V<small>is</small> and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with H<small>yper</small>V<small>is</small> and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.
Earth scientists are increasingly employing time series data with multiple dimensions and high temporal resolution to study the impacts of climate and environmental changes on Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. However, the large number of variables and varying time scales of antecedent conditions contributing to natural phenomena hinder scientists from completing more than the most basic analyses. In this paper, we present EVis (Environmental Visualization), a new visual analytics prototype to help scientists analyze and explore recurring environmental events (e.g. rock fracture, landslides, heat waves, floods) and their relationships with high dimensional time series of continuous numeric environmental variables, such as ambient temperature and precipitation. EVis provides coordinated scatterplots, heatmaps, histograms, and RadViz for foundational analyses. These features allow users to interactively examine relationships between events and one, two, three, or more environmental variables. EVis also provides a novel visual analytics approach to allowing users to discover temporally lagging relationships related to antecedent conditions between events and multiple variables, a critical task in Earth sciences. In particular, this latter approach projects multivariate time series onto trajectories in a 2D space using RadViz, and clusters the trajectories for temporal pattern discovery. Our case studies with rock cracking data and interviews with domain experts from a range of sub-disciplines within Earth sciences illustrate the extensive applicability and usefulness of EVis.
Building a visual overview of temporal event sequences with an optimal level-of-detail (i.e. simplified but informative) is an ongoing challenge - expecting the user to zoom into every important aspect of the overview can lead to missing insights. We propose a technique to build a multilevel overview of event sequences, whose granularity can be transformed across sequence clusters (vertical level-of-detail) or longitudinally (horizontal level-of-detail), using hierarchical aggregation and a novel cluster data representation Align-Score-Simplify. By default, the overview shows an optimal number of sequence clusters obtained through the average silhouette width metric - then users are able to explore alternative optimal sequence clusterings. The vertical level-of-detail of the overview changes along with the number of clusters, whilst the horizontal level-of-detail refers to the level of summarization applied to each cluster representation. The proposed technique has been implemented into a visualization system called Sequence Cluster Explorer (Sequen-C) that allows multilevel and detail-on-demand exploration through three coordinated views, and the inspection of data attributes at cluster, unique sequence, and individual sequence level. We present two case studies using real-world datasets in the healthcare domain: CUREd and MIMIC-III; which demonstrate how the technique can aid users to obtain a summary of common and deviating pathways, and explore data attributes for selected patterns.
In theory, efficient and high-quality rendering of unstructured data should greatly benefit from modern GPUs, but in practice, GPUs are often limited by the large amount of memory that large meshes require for element representation and for sample reconstruction acceleration structures. We describe a memory-optimized encoding for large unstructured meshes that efficiently encodes both the unstructured mesh and corresponding sample reconstruction acceleration structure, while still allowing for fast random-access sampling as required for rendering. We demonstrate that for large data our encoding allows for rendering even the 2.9 billion element Mars Lander on a single off-the-shelf GPU-and the largest 6.3 billion version on a pair of such GPUs.
Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.
Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.
One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.
The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.
The combination of diverse data types and analysis tasks in genomics has resulted in the development of a wide range of visualization techniques and tools. However, most existing tools are tailored to a specific problem or data type and offer limited customization, making it challenging to optimize visualizations for new analysis tasks or datasets. To address this challenge, we designed Gosling-a grammar for interactive and scalable genomics data visualization. Gosling balances expressiveness for comprehensive multi-scale genomics data visualizations with accessibility for domain scientists. Our accompanying JavaScript toolkit called Gosling.js provides scalable and interactive rendering. Gosling.js is built on top of an existing platform for web-based genomics data visualization to further simplify the visualization of common genomics data formats. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the grammar through a variety of real-world examples. Furthermore, we show how Gosling supports the design of novel genomics visualizations. An online editor and examples of Gosling.js, its source code, and documentation are available at <uri>https://gosling.js.org</uri>.
Circular glyphs are used across disparate fields to represent multidimensional data. However, although these glyphs are extremely effective, creating them is often laborious, even for those with professional design skills. This paper presents GlyphCreator, an interactive tool for the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator promptly generates a list of design candidates, any of which can be edited to satisfy the requirements of a particular representation. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs by summarizing relationships between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment, demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through two use scenarios, and validate its effectiveness through user interviews.
The efficiency of warehouses is vital to e-commerce. Fast order processing at the warehouses ensures timely deliveries and improves customer satisfaction. However, monitoring, analyzing, and manipulating order processing in the warehouses in real time are challenging for traditional methods due to the sheer volume of incoming orders, the fuzzy definition of delayed order patterns, and the complex decision-making of order handling priorities. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance. The effectiveness of OrderMonitor is evaluated with two case studies on a real-world warehouse dataset.
We present a pyramid-based scatterplot sampling technique to avoid overplotting and enable progressive and streaming visualization of large data. Our technique is based on a multiresolution pyramid-based decomposition of the underlying density map and makes use of the density values in the pyramid to guide the sampling at each scale for preserving the relative data densities and outliers. We show that our technique is competitive in quality with state-of-the-art methods and runs faster by about an order of magnitude. Also, we have adapted it to deliver progressive and streaming data visualization by processing the data in chunks and updating the scatterplot areas with visible changes in the density map. A quantitative evaluation shows that our approach generates stable and faithful progressive samples that are comparable to the state-of-the-art method in preserving relative densities and superior to it in keeping outliers and stability when switching frames. We present two case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for exploring large data.
Professional roles for data visualization designers are growing in popularity, and interest in relationships between the academic research and professional practice communities is gaining traction. However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding visualization design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These findings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.
State-of-the-art computation and visualization of vortices in unsteady fluid flow employ objective vortex criteria, which makes them independent of reference frames or observers. However, objectivity by itself, although crucial, is not sufficient to guarantee that one can identify physically-realizable observers that would perceive or detect the same vortices. Moreover, a significant challenge is that a single reference frame is often not sufficient to accurately observe multiple vortices that follow different motions. This paper presents a novel framework for the exploration and use of an interactively-chosen set of observers, of the resulting relative velocity fields, and of objective vortex structures. We show that our approach facilitates the objective detection and visualization of vortices relative to well-adapted reference frame motions, while at the same time guaranteeing that these observers are in fact physically realizable. In order to represent and manipulate observers efficiently, we make use of the low-dimensional vector space structure of the Lie algebra of physically-realizable observer motions. We illustrate that our framework facilitates the efficient choice and guided exploration of objective vortices in unsteady 2D flow, on planar as well as on spherical domains, using well-adapted reference frames.
The authors describe some mathematical approaches and computer graphics techniques for illustrating concepts related to Fermat's last theorem. They present a selection of visualization methods, and describe observations made in the process of creating a three-minute computer animated videotape dealing with some elementary aspects of Fermat's last theorem, a problem in number theory. The approach to the representation of the different concepts presented in the video was influenced by many factors: the available hardware, real and perceived constraints of the available software, constraints imposed by the video medium, and a number of peculiarities and features of the mathematical domain itself. The authors describe the experiences with the software systems that played a part in these efforts, some specific successful visualization techniques, and some unexpected mathematical insights.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A methodology for guiding the choice of visual representations of data is presented. The methodology provides objective and directed display design facilities. Such facilities can guide interactive visualization design, generate standard visualizations automatically, and assess the extent to which chosen representations can convey the required information to data analysis. The methodology is based on objectively distinguishing the types of information conveyed by various visual representations and matching these to the intrinsic characteristics of data and to aims for its interpretation. This approach is directed toward developing a stronger theoretical basis for visualization in scientific computation. The methodology is developed using a natural scene paradigm in which data variables are represented by identifiable properties of realistic scenes.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The author applied image processing and volume rendering algorithms together with considerations on the physiology of the human visual system to improve the quality of perception of the information contained in positron emission tomography (PET) brain images, and to highlight the existing anatomical information. The psychophysical considerations for selecting color and brightness level are used to visualize functional and anatomical structures in three dimensions. One is able to perceive in the images the levels of rates of glucose metabolism of regions in the brain and their relative locations. In addition, some of the anatomic structures, such as the interhemispheric fissure, the caudate nucleus, and the thalamus, are apparent.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Summary form only given. The basic parameters of current TV, the origins of HDTV, and the various types of TV systems being proposed in Japan, America and Europe are reviewed. Available HDTV hardware, new applications that this hardware enables, and the economics involved are discussed. How HDTV fits into the film and television industries from the perspectives of production, distribution, and creativity, HDTV's demands upon telecommunications, and why data compression plays a critical role have been examined. The evolution of the present workstation from many analytical perspectives, leading up to the most recent product introductions of all the major vendors, developments in accelerator boards and interactive graphics peripherals, and the evolution of the man/machine interface are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The problem of presenting and gaining deeper understanding of a multidimensional system, a mathematical model Predicting 20-90 s oscillations in breathing, is presented. The authors utilized custom software for interactive analysis of a three-dimensional model, plus Wavefront software to render translucent images of the 3D surfaces. The results show that under conditions of no peripheral chemosensor sensitivity, periodic breathing is predicted to occur with (1) an increase in circulatory transit time between the lungs and brain, (2) the presence of marked steady state hypoventilation, and/or (3) an increase in brain blood flow rate. It is concluded that the peripheral chemosensors (carotid bodies) are not essential for the development of periodic breathing.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Summary form only given, as follows. Historically, scientific visualization has been carried out in two primary modes: interactive on desktop computers, and batch on high-performance computers. The next decade will see a merging of these two approaches with the advent of high-speed networking. The networking is hierarchical in speed from Ethernet to FDDI to HiPPI. This network effectively unites desktop computers with higher-value remote resources into a single metacomputer. To take advantage of this new hardware configuration, distributed visualization software is being developed which allows the flexibility of the local workstation to be coupled with the computing power of distant supercomputers. Examples are discussed for 2D raster graphics and 3D rendered surface and volumetric graphics. These new capabilities are having a remarkable impact on computational science.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The use of ray casting in volume rendering and its uses and advantages over surface rendering algorithms are discussed. Various adaptive algorithms that attempt to overcome its problem of high computational cost by taking advantage of image coherency and the bandlimited nature of volume data are described. A method of subdividing the image plane with isosceles triangles, instead of quadrants as is usually done is proposed. It results in fewer rays being fired without sacrificing image quality. A brief theoretical analysis of the algorithm in comparison with other methods is given.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Addresses 3D visualization techniques now being developed that are specific to coarse, irregular grid fields such as finite-element models. These include direct-generation of isovalues from finite elements, display of 3D gradient and tensor quantities, and the display of multiple states of behavior, items common to general 3D visualization, but with specific algorithmic and implementation issues in finite element analysis.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Addresses the issue of the use of color, as compared to monochromatic displays, in visualization. The paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of color displays, and those of monochromic displays, identifies situations where color can improve the representation, those where it will degrade it, and suggest guidelines on how (and when) to use color.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper emphasizes the need for and importance of remote visualization. The potential impact of remote visualization on application algorithms, communication protocols, and underlying networks is assessed. Opportunities for research and development to support remote visualization in the context of the National Research and Education network are outlined.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper looks at the role visualization and visual data analysis play in the technical community. It focuses on the premise that the wide variety of applications of visualization mandate a need for a variety of visualization software packages.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper addresses the question of how the work of the scientist will change in the new multimedia environments. Scenarios for the process of simulating and analyzing data in such environments are constructed, and some of the underlying models used in their construction are examined.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
This paper examines the role of experimental design, data acquisition equipment, and system integration in the holistic solution picture. Issues include data formats, distributed computing environments, and the need for truly interactive, even real-time systems. A major theme is reaching beyond volume visualization to 'volume comprehension' through volume segmentation, mensuration, and geometry extraction.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A collaboration designed to demonstrate the possibilities of access to supercomputers via the high-speed wide-area networks in order to carry out sophisticated, interactive visualization on local workstations is described. The test case was visualization of 3D magnetic resonance imaging data, with a Vray performing surface reconstruction to generate a set of triangles. The resulting geometric data was sent to a local workstation to be rendered, with minor enhancements to current network protocols enabling effective utilization of the 45 Mb bandwidth of a T3-based network.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A three-dimensional finite-element hydrodynamic model was constructed to simulate tidal cycles in Galveston Bay over a one-year period in order to view changes in water velocities and salinity. A project undertaken to visualize the simulation results is reported. The project comprised analyzing model requirements and determining suitable visualization techniques, visualizing a preliminary, smaller-scale model to verify the techniques; and visualizing the full-scale model. Problems encountered and resolutions of problems at each stage are described. Validation, as well as insights revealed about the model through the preliminary and final visualization, are discussed. Current application of visualization techniques to the model is reported.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A brief example of the visualization and quantification of a complex fluid interaction is presented in order to give one a feeling for the difficulty of dealing with geometrical and topological questions in three dimensions and time. To obtain a quantitative understanding, visiometric techniques, including thresholding, object isolation, ellipsoid fitting, abstraction, vector field line generation and data juxtaposition, were used.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A new way of reconstructing human fossils from fragmentary fossil material is described. Unlike the traditional method of making physical models using clay, this new approach is based on geometrical modeling and visualization of digitized fossil data. It can provide anthropologists with both quantifiable, computer-based geometric models and physical plastic reconstructions of fossils.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses the breadth and the effectiveness of application visualization systems (AVSs). The current and future research areas involving AVSs, drawbacks and limitations of certain application areas, possible improvements to AVSs, and alternative analysis and visualization approaches are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses the uses of visualization in the field of neuroscience is reported. The applications discussed are image analysis for basic neurobiological problems, image analysis from basic to applied neurobiological problems, management of images and graphics from anatomical experiments, and visualization and analysis of multivariate electrophysiological data sets.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses efforts to develop virtual environment (VE) systems. The applications discussed are medical telesurgery, maintenance access, presence simulators, accounting visualizations, topographic visualizations and tools to assist developers in determining the value added of potential VE-based solutions.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses the ways in which the understanding of visual perception could help improve the scientific visualization process. It is argued that as long as there is a human interface link to computer visualization systems, understanding how humans perceive information visually could help improve the quality and the effectiveness of the visualization process. The fields of visual physiology, psychophysics, and cognitive psychology can explain why human vision is so efficient, how to create better images, and how to determine the limitations of particular representations.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses issues relating to the complexity of scientific visualization software system implementation. It is argued that the complexity of current implementations of such systems may limit the utility for users because the interfaces typically require significant knowledge of the data being studied and the applicable visualization algorithms, as well as its infrastructure of graphics, imaging and data handling technology. The issues, unknowns, and possible solutions associated with building effective scientific visualization software are discussed.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Discusses issues relating to the state of the art in scientific data management. Management of scientific data sets or databases is reviewed. The generic science requirements, as well as a case example that drives the underlying data management system architecture are explored, showing current technology limitations. A concept of intelligent information fusion with sufficient detail on how to integrate advanced technologies to enhance scientific production, is presented. Emphasis is on user interfaces, spatial data structure, uses of neural networks for extracting information from scientific imagery, uses of object-oriented database management systems, animation, and visualization techniques.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Experiments in visualizing implications of landscape planning and design decisions using a combination of GIS, CAD, and video animation technology are described. Simple grid-cell GIS databases and site-scale polygonal models are used to provide visualizations of site planning design proposals and environmental impact, with both static and animated images. Rather than pursuing photo-realistic simulations, the focus is on how abstractions and representational conventions can be used to gauge visual and environmental effects of proposals for landscape change, in a dynamic interactive computer-aided design environment.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A two-pass surface extraction algorithm for adaptive finite-element meshes is presented in the context of a visualization study for a particle impact and a turbine-blade containment problem. The direct use of finite-element data structures for the computation of external surfaces, surface normals, and derived physical qualities is discussed. An overview of the in-betweening which accounts for rigid body dynamics effects is presented, with a brief discussion of a direct-to-videodisk animation strategy.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Modular application builders (MABs), such as AVS and Iris Explorer are increasingly being used in the visualization community. Such systems can already place compute intensive modules on supercomputers in order to utilize their power. This paper details two major projects at EPCC which attempted to fully integrate the MAB concept with a distributed memory MIMD (DM-MIMD) environment. The work presented was driven by two goals, efficient use of the resource and case of use by programmer and end user. We present a model of MABs and describe the major problems faced, giving solutions to them through two case studies.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Volume visualization is becoming an important tool for understanding large 3D data sets. A popular technique for volume rendering is known as splatting. With new hardware architectures offering substantial improvements in the performance of rendering texture mapped objects, we present textured splats. An ideal reconstruction function for 3D signals is developed which can be used as a texture map for a splat. Extensions to the basic splatting technique are then developed to additionally represent vector fields.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Some techniques developed recently at DLR's Institute of Theoretical Fluid Mechanics in order to cope with the demands arising from today's work in aerodynamics are illustrated. Such new demands arise from new aerodynamical problems like the hypersonic flow field around re-entry vehicles, the study of unsteady phenomena which comes more and more within reach due to the increased availability of computing power and the tendency towards enhanced international cooperation especially within Europe which calls for the use of co-operative systems on wide area networks.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A discussion is given on the validation, verification and evaluation of scientific visualization software. A "bug" usually refers to software doing something different than the programmer intended. Comprehensive testing, especially for software intended for use in innovative environments, is hard. Descriptions and summaries of the tests we have done are often not available to the users. A different source of visualization errors is software that does something different than what the scientist thinks it does. The particular methods used to compute values in the process of creating visualizations are important to the scientists, but vendors are understandably reluctant to reveal all the internals of their products. Is there a workable compromise? Another vulnerability of visualization users is in the choice of a technique which is less effective than others equally available. Visualization researchers and developers should give users the information required to make good decisions about competing visualization techniques. What information is needed? What will it take to gather and distribute it? How should it be tied to visualization software?.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
A visualization goal is to simplify the analysis of large-quantity, numerical data by rendering the data as an image that can be intuitively manipulated. The question the article addresses is whether or not virtual reality techniques are the cure-all to the dilemma of visualizing increasing amounts of data. It determines the usefulness of techniques available today and in the near future that will ease the problem of visualizing complex data. In regards to visualization, the article discusses characteristics of virtual reality systems, data in three-dimensional environments, augmented reality, and virtual reality market opportunities.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Visualization techniques are applied to an electric power system transmission network to create a graphical picture of network power flows and voltages. A geographic data map is used. Apparent power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow, with direction from real power flow. Flows are superposed on flow limits. Contour plots and color coding failed for representing bus voltages. A two-color thermometer encoding worked well. The resulting visualization is a significant improvement over current user interface practice in the power industry.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
The recent advent of computer graphics techniques has helped to bridge the gap between architectural concepts and actual buildings. Closing this gap is especially critical in healthcare facilities. We present new techniques to support the design decision process and apply them to the design of a neonatal intensive care unit. Two issues are addressed: ergonometric accessibility and visual supervision of spaces. These two issues can be investigated utilizing new technologies that demonstrate that computers are more then a medium of communication in the field of architecture; the computer can make a significant contribution as a proactive design tool.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
3D ultrasound is one of the most interesting non-invasive, non-radiative tomographic techniques. Rendering 3D models from such data is not straightforward due to the noisy, fuzzy nature of ultrasound imaging containing a lot of artefacts. We first apply speckle, median and gaussian prefiltering to improve the image quality. Using several semi-automatic segmentation tools we isolate interesting features within a few minutes. Our improved surface-extraction procedure enables volume rendering of high quality within a few seconds on a normal workstation, thus making the complete system suitable for routine clinical applications.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Augmented reality systems with see-through headmounted displays have been used primarily for applications that are possible with today's computational capabilities. We explore possibilities for a particular application-in-place, real-time 3D ultrasound visualization-without concern for such limitations. The question is not "How well could we currently visualize the fetus in real time," but "How well could we see the fetus if we had sufficient compute power?" Our video sequence shows a 3D fetus within a pregnant woman's abdomen-the way this would look to a HMD user. Technical problems in making the sequence are discussed. This experience exposed limitations of current augmented reality systems; it may help define the capabilities of future systems needed for applications as demanding as real-time medical visualization.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
Environmental issues such as global warming are an active area of international research and concern today. This case study describes various visualization paradigms that have been developed and applied in an attempt to elucidate the information provided by environmental models and observations. The ultimate goal is to accurately measure the existence of any long term climatological change. The global ocean is the starting point, since it is a major source and sink of heat within our global environment.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In this paper we show how SAVS, a tool for visualization and data analysis in space and atmospheric science, can be used to quickly and easily address problems that would previously have been far more laborious to solve. Based on the popular AVS package, SAVS presents the user with an environment tailored specifically for the physical scientist. Thus there is minimal "startup" time, and the scientist can immediately concentrate on his science problem. The SAVS concept readily generalizes to many other fields of science and engineering.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
One of the most fundamental issues in magnetic fusion research is the understanding of turbulent transport observed in present-day tokamak experiments. Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. Recent developments in algorithms along with the astounding advances in high performance computing now make first-principle particle simulations an important tool for improved understanding of such phenomena. Due to the five dimensional phase space (3 spatial, 2 velocity) and complex toroidal geometry, visualization is crucial for interpreting such simulation data. This paper discusses how visualization tools are currently used and what new physics has been elucidated, along with what can be learned about tokamak turbulence through the interplay between theory, simulation and visualization.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;
In the research described, we have constructed a tightly coupled set of methods for monitoring, steering, and applying visual analysis to large scale simulations. The work shows how a collaborative, interdisciplinary process that teams application and computer scientists can result in a powerful integrated approach. The integrated design allows great flexibility in the development and use of analysis tools. The work also shows that visual analysis is a necessary component for full understanding of spatially complex, time dependent atmospheric processes.
A new method of tracking free ranging marine mammals has been developed which employs a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to accurately fix an animal's position when it surfaces and a tri axial magnetometer and velocity time depth recorder to track the animals underwater movements between surfacings in 3 dimensions. Concurrent with the development of the electronics of this movement and position tracking (MAP) tracking system has been the development of ways to analyze data from the MAP system. Spray rendering has been used to visualize the data and to combine it with environmental data allowing biologists view the animals activity in an environmental context. Considerable effort has been has been made to incorporate estimations of uncertainty and ways of minimizing it into our visualizations of the data.
As part of a large effort evaluating the effect of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, we are using the spatial selection features of an object relational database management system to support the visualization of the ecological data. The effort, called the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA), is collecting and analyzing oceanographic and biological data from Prince William Sound in Alaska. To support visualization of the SEA data we are building a data management system which includes a spatial index over a bounding polygon for all of the datasets which are collected. In addition to other selection criteria the prototype provides several methods for selecting data within an arbitrary region. This case study presents the requirements and the implementation for the application prototype which combines visualization and database technology. The spatial indexing features of the Illustra object relational database management system are linked with the visualization capabilities of AVS to create an interactive environment for analysis of SEA data.
The definition of consonance as the ability to resolve a sound into the pitch categories is introduced. For a vector space of chords a norm is used to evaluate the consonance linearly in dependence of the instrument used. It is shown that in the corresponding Hilbert space the chords which usually appear together in a conventional musical piece are recognized in terms of "closeness".
The paper presents an example of how existing visualization methods can be successfully applied-after minor modifications-for allowing new, sometimes unexpected insight into scientific questions, in this case for better understanding of unknown, microscopic biological structures. The authors present a volume rendering system supporting the visualization of LCM datasets, a new microscopic tomographic method allowing for the first time accurate and fast in-vivo inspection of the spatial structure of microscopic structures, especially important in (but not restricted to) biology. The speed, flexibility and versatility of the system allows fast, convenient, interactive operation with large datasets on small computers (workstation or PC). By testing different datasets, they have been able to significantly improve the performance of understanding the internal structure of LCM data. Most important, they have been able to show static and dynamic structures of cells never seen before and allowing significant insight in the cell movement process. Therefore they regard the system as a universal tool for the visualization of such data.
The recent years have seen rapid advancement towards viewing the Earth as an integrated system. This means that we have come to understand the interdependence of the major planetary subsystems-atmosphere, biosphere, oceans and the deep earth interior-on a large range of time and length scales. One of the longest time scales of the planet is imposed by solid state convection within the silicate Earth mantle. Mantle convection modeling, and other earth science modeling efforts, now are producing simulation data on grids that are large enough to strain the memory and processing power of even the largest high-end graphics workstations. Another alternative is to use parallel visualization tools running on the massively parallel computers that generated the data. This is the approach that we have taken for the visualization of mantle convection simulation data.


The authors give I/O-optimal techniques for the extraction of isosurfaces from volumetric data, by a novel application of the I/O-optimal interval tree of Arge and Vitter (1996). The main idea is to preprocess the data set once and for all to build an efficient search structure in disk, and then each time one wants to extract an isosurface, they perform an output-sensitive query on the search structure to retrieve only those active cells that are intersected by the isosurface. During the query operation, only two blocks of main memory space are needed, and only those active cells are brought into the main memory, plus some negligible overhead of disk accesses. This implies that one can efficiently visualize very large data sets on workstations with just enough main memory to hold the isosurfaces themselves. The implementation is delicate but not complicated. They give the first implementation of the I/O-optimal interval tree, and also implement their methods as an I/O filter for Vtk's isosurface extraction for the case of unstructured grids. They show that, in practice, the algorithms improve the performance of isosurface extraction by speeding up the active-cell searching process so that it is no longer a bottleneck. Moreover, this search time is independent of the main memory available. The practical efficiency of the techniques reflects their theoretical optimality.
The ability to forecast the progress of crisis events would significantly reduce human suffering and loss of life, the destruction of property and expenditures for assessment and recovery. Los Alamos National Laboratory has established a scientific thrust in crisis forecasting to address this national challenge. In the initial phase of this project, scientists at Los Alamos are developing computer models to predict the spread of a wildfire. Visualization of the results of the wildfire simulation will be used by scientists to assess the quality of the simulation and eventually by fire personnel as a visual forecast of the wildfire's evolution. The fire personnel and scientists want the visualization to look as realistic as possible without compromising scientific accuracy. This paper describes how the visualization was created, analyzes the tools and approach that were used, and suggests directions for future work and research.
We describe a set of visualization programs developed for understanding segmentations of customer records produced by a self organizing map (SOM) algorithm. A SOM produces segments of similar customer records that can then be used as the basis of a marketing campaign. Since the characteristics that each segment will have in common are not specified a priori, visualization is essential to understanding the segment to design specific marketing strategies. Two different styles of visualizations were found to be useful for the two types of observers of the data. Abstract overviews of the entire segmentation were designed for analysts applying the SOM algorithm. Detailed scatterplots of individual records were designed for communicating the results to decision makers specifying marketing strategy.
Numerical finite element simulations of the behaviour of a car body in frontal, side or rear impact collision scenarios have become increasingly complex as well as reliable and precise. They are well-established as a standard evaluation tool in the automotive development process. Both the increased complexity and the advances in computer graphics technology have resulted in the need for new visualization techniques to facilitate the analysis of the immense amount of data originating from such scientific engineering computations. Expanding the effectiveness of traditional post-processing techniques is one key to achieve shorter design cycles and faster time-to-market. In this paper, we describe how the extensive use of texture mapping and new visualization mappings like force tubing can considerably enhance the post-processing of structural and physical properties of car components in crash simulations. We show that, using these techniques, both the calculation costs and the rendering costs are reduced, and the quality of the visualization is improved.
We present the design of a simulator for a prototype interventional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This MRI scanner is integrated with an operating theater, enabling new techniques in minimally invasive surgery. The simulator is designed with a threefold purpose: to provide a rehearsal apparatus for practicing and modifying conventional procedures for use in the magnetic environment; to serve as a visualization workstation for procedure planning and previewing as well as a post-operative review; and to form the foundation of a laboratory workbench for the development of new surgical tools and procedures for minimally invasive surgery. The simulator incorporates pre-operative data, either MRI or CT exams, as well as data from commercial surgical planning systems. Dynamic control of the simulation and interactive display of pre-operative data in lieu of intra-operative data is handled via an opto-electronic tracking system. The resulting system is contributing insights into how best to perform visualization for this new surgical environment.
We present an external memory algorithm for fast display of very large and complex geometric environments. We represent the model using a scene graph and employ different culling techniques for rendering acceleration. Our algorithm uses a parallel approach to render the scene as well as fetch objects from the disk in a synchronous manner. We present a novel prioritized prefetching technique that takes into account LOD-switching and visibility-based events between successive frames. We have applied our algorithm to large gigabyte-sized environments that are composed of thousands of objects and tens of millions of polygons. The memory overhead of our algorithm is output sensitive and is typically tens of megabytes. In practice, our approach scales with the model sizes, and its rendering performance is comparable to that of an in-core algorithm.
In this paper, we present a verification algorithm for swirling features in flow fields, based on the geometry of streamlines. The features of interest in this case are vortices. Without a formal definition, existing detection algorithms lack the ability to accurately identify these features, and the current method for verifying the accuracy of their results is by human visual inspection. Our verification algorithm addresses this issue by automating the visual inspection process. It is based on identifying the swirling streamlines that surround the candidate vortex cores. We apply our algorithm to both numerically simulated and procedurally generated datasets to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.
This paper presents a new technique for visualizing large, complex collections of data. The size and dimensionality of these datasets make them challenging to display in an effective manner. The images must show the global structure of spatial relationships within the dataset, yet at the same time accurately represent the local detail of each data element being visualized. We propose combining ideas from information and scientific visualization together with a navigation assistant, a software system designed to help users identify and explore areas of interest within their data. The assistant locates data elements of potential importance to the user, clusters them into spatial regions, and builds underlying graph structures to connect the regions and the elements they contain. Graph traversal algorithms, constraint-based viewpoint construction, and intelligent camera planning techniques can then be used to design animated tours of these regions. In this way, the navigation assistant can help users to explore any of the areas of interest within their data. We conclude by demonstrating how our assistant is being used to visualize a multidimensional weather dataset.

We combine topological and geometric methods to construct a multi-resolution data structure for functions over two-dimensional domains. Starting with the Morse-Smale complex, we construct a topological hierarchy by progressively canceling critical points in pairs. Concurrently, we create a geometric hierarchy by adapting the geometry to the changes in topology. The data structure supports mesh traversal operations similarly to traditional multi-resolution representations.
In this paper, we propose a novel out-of-core isosurface extraction technique for large time-varying fields over irregular grids. We employ our meta-cell technique to explore the spatial coherence of the data, and our time tree algorithm to consider the temporal coherence as well. Our one-time preprocessing phase first partitions the dataset into meta-cells that cluster spatially neighboring cells together and are stored in disk. We then build a time tree to index the meta-cells for fast isosurface extraction. The time tree takes advantage of the temporal coherence among the scalar values at different time steps, and uses BBIO trees as secondary structures, which are stored in disk and support I/O-optimal interval searches. The time tree algorithm employs a novel meta-interval collapsing scheme and the buffer technique, to take care of the temporal coherence in an I/O-efficient way. We further make the time tree cache-oblivious, so that searching on it automatically performs optimal number of block transfers between any two consecutive levels of memory hierarchy (such as between cache and main memory and between main memory and disk) simultaneously. At run-time, we perform optimal cache-oblivious searches in the time tree, together with I/O-optimal searches in the BBIO trees, to read the active meta-cells from disk and generate the queried isosurface efficiently. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our new technique. In particular, compared with the query-optimal main-memory algorithm by Cignoni et al. (1997) (extended for time-varying fields) when there is not enough main memory, our technique can speed up the isosurface queries from more than 18 hours to less than 4 minutes.
We introduce a new method for visualizing symmetric tensor fields. The technique produces images and animations reminiscent of line integral convolution (LIC). The technique is also slightly related to hyperstreamlines in that it is used to visualize tensor fields. However, the similarity ends there. HyperLIC uses a multi-pass approach to show the anisotropic properties in a 2D or 3D tensor field. We demonstrate this technique using data sets from computational fluid dynamics as well as diffusion-tensor MRI.
